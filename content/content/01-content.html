<h2>Readings</h2>
<p>As noted in the syllabus, your readings will be assigned each week in this area. For this initial week, please read the course content. <strong>Read closely</strong> the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/syllabus/">syllabus</a>, <a href="/content/">content</a>, <a href="/example/">examples</a>, and <a href="/lab/">labs</a> pages for this class.</li>
<li>This page. Yes, the whole thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Things to stress from syllabus:</p>
<ul>
<li>E-mail isn’t the ideal solution for technical problems</li>
<li>No appointments necessary for regularly scheduled office hours; or by appointment.</li>
<li>TA office hours are great as well. Our TA has experience in this course.</li>
<li>Can only reschedule exams (with good reason) if you tell me <strong>before</strong> the exam that you have a conflict.
<ul>
<li>Notify me immediately if you need accommodations because of RCPD or religious convictions; If you approach me at the last minute, I may not be able to help.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Despite my apparent hard-assness, I’m here to help. I am not in the business of giving bad grades for no reason, and I genuinely want you to learn a lot and enjoy the course.</p>

<h4>Hal Varian, Chief Economist, Google</h4>
</div>
<div id="about-me" class="section level3">
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> My primary area of expertise is behavioral economics (also known as psychology and economics). While my research occasionally touches the topics in the course, I mostly utilize things in the course as tools. In this way, we are likely the same.</p>
<p>This class is totally, unapologetically a work in progress. The material is a mish-mash of stuff from courses offered at Caltech, Stanford, Harvard, and Duke…so, yeah, it will be challenging. Hopefully, you’ll find it fun!</p>
</div>
<div id="about-you" class="section level3">
<h3>About You</h3>
<div class="fyi">
<p><em>New phone who dis?</em> Please email me bbushong@msu.edu your</p>
<ul>
<li><p>name (with pronunciation guide)</p></li>
<li><p>major</p></li>

<li><p>interest in this course on a 10-point scale (1: not at all interested; 10: helllllll yeah)</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>You <strong>must</strong> spend 5 minutes emailing me a little bit about your interests before the next class.</p>
</div>
<div id="this-course" class="section level3">
<h3>This Course</h3>
<p>The syllabus is posted on the course website. I’ll walk through highlights now, but read it later – it’s long.
- But eventually, please read it. It is “required.”</p>
<p>Syllabus highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grade is composed of weekly writings, labs, and projects.
<ul>
<li>Weekly writings: 22%</li>
<li>Participation: 4%</li>
<li>Labs: 29%</li>
<li>Projects: 45%</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This structure is designed to give ~55% “for free”. Success on the projects will require real work.</li>
<li>Labs consist of a practical implementation of something we’ve covered in the course (e.g., code your own Recommender System).</li>
</ul>
<div id="grading" class="section level4">
<h4>Grading</h4>
<p>Grading: <strong>come to class.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If</strong> you complete all assignments and attend all class dates, I suspect you will do very well. Given the way the syllabus is structured, I conjecture that the following is a loose guide to grades:</p>
<p><code>4.0</code> Turned in all assignments with good effort, worked hard on the projects and was proud of final product.</p>
<p><code>3.5</code> Turned in all assignments with good effort, worked a bit on the projects and was indifferent to final product.</p>
<p><code>3.0</code> Turned in all assignments with some effort, worked a bit on the projects and was shy about final product.</p>
<p><code>&lt; 3.0</code> Very little effort, or did not turn in all assignments, worked very little on the projects and was embarassed by final product.</p>
<p>…of course, failing to turn in assignments can lead to a grade dramatically <strong>lower</strong> than just a 3.0.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="more-about-this-course" class="section level3">
<h3>More About This Course</h3>
<p>There are sort of three texts for this course and sort of zero.</p>
<p>The “main text” is free and available online. The secondary text is substantially more difficult, but also free online. The third text costs about $25. Assigned readings can be found on the course website under “Content”.</p>
<p><strong>Please please please please please:</strong> Ask questions during class.
- Most ideas will be new.
- Sometimes (often?) the material itself will be confusing or interesting—or both!
- Teaching is incredibly challenging right now.
- <strong>Note:</strong> If I find that attendance is terrible, I may have to start incorporating attendance into participation.</p>
<p>Return of the Please: If there is some topic that you really want to learn about, ask. If you are uncomfortable asking in front of the whole group, please see me during office hours.</p>
<p>Because this is a new course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the lectures will be way too long or too short.</li>
<li>Some (most?) of the lectures won’t make sense.</li>
<li>Some of the time I’ll forget what I intended to say and awkwardly stare at you for a few moments (sorry).</li>
</ul>
<p>Comment <strong>throughout</strong> the course, not just at the end.</p>
<p>The material will improve with time and feedback.</p>
<p>I encourage measured feedback and thoughtful responses to questions. If I call on you and you don’t know immediately, don’t freak out. If you don’t know, it’s totally okay to say you don’t know.</p>
<div id="super-big-important-explanation-of-the-course" class="section level4">
<h4>SUPER BIG IMPORTANT EXPLANATION OF THE COURSE</h4>
<p>We teach using “math”. Don’t be afraid. The math won’t hurt you. I fundamentally believe that true knowledge of how we learn from data depends on a basic understanding of the underlying mathematics.</p>
<p>-The good news is that you’ll face no black boxes. In this class you’ll <strong>actually learn</strong> how things work. (Probably. Hopefully?)
-More good news: the level of required math is reasonably low. High-school algebra or equivalent should be fine.
-The bad news is that (at times) the course is notation-heavy. This class will require an active mind.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="and-finally" class="section level3">
<h3>And finally…</h3>
<p>I cannot address field-specific questions in areas outside economics to any satisfying degree. I’m good at knowing what I don’t know and have a very small ego, which means that I’m much less likely to blow smoke up your ass than other professors. So I won’t pretend I know everything. Of course, this implies that I can’t help with certain types of questions.</p>
<p>This course should be applicable broadly, but many of the examples will lean on my personal expertise (sorry).</p>
</div>
<div id="guiding-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Guiding Questions</h3>
<p>For future lectures, the guiding questions will be more pointed and at a higher level to help steer your thinking. Here, we want to ensure you remember some basics and accordingly the questions are straightforward.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you remember anything about <code>R</code>?</li>
<li>What are the different data types in <code>R</code>?</li>
<li>How do you index specific elements of a vector? Why might you want to do that?</li>
</ul>

<div id="what-is-data-analytics" class="section level1">
<h1>What is “Data Analytics”?</h1>
<p>How do <strong>you</strong> define “data analytics”? (Not a rhetorical question!)</p>
<ul>
<li>This course will avoid this nomenclature. It is confusing and imprecise. But you signed up (suckers) and I owe an explanation of what this course will cover.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some “data analytics” topics we will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear regression (<em>il classico</em>).</li>
<li>Models of classification or discrete choice.</li>
<li>Analysis of ``wide’’ data.</li>
<li>Decision trees and other non-linear models.</li>
</ul>
<div id="starting-point-for-this-course" class="section level2">
<h2>Starting point for this course</h2>
<p>Better utilizing existing data can improve our predictive power whilst providing interpretable outputs for considering new policies.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Causation is tough and we will spend the entire course warning you to avoid making causal claims!</p>
<div id="statistical-learning" class="section level3">
<h3>Statistical Learning</h3>
<p><strong>A Brief History</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you are a researcher and you want to teach a computer to recognize images of a tree.</p>
<p>Note: this is an ``easy” problem. If you show pictures to a 3-year-old, that child will probably be able to tell you if there is a tree in the picture.</p>
<p>Computer scientists spent about 20 years on this problem because they thought about the problem like nerds and tried to write down a series of rules.</p>
<p>Rules are difficult to form, and simply writing rules misses the key insight: the data can tell you something.</p>
<div id="social-science-approaches-to-statistical-learning" class="section level4">
<h4>Social Science Approaches to Statistical Learning</h4>
<p><strong>A Brief History</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you are a researcher and you want to know whether prisons reduce crime.</p>
<p>from ``A Call for a Moratorium on Prison Building’’ (1976)</p>
<ul>
<li>Between 1955 and 1975, fifteen states increased the collective capacity of their adult prison systems by 56% (from, on average, 63,100 to 98,649).</li>
<li>Fifteen other states increased capacity by less than 4% (from 49,575 to 51,440).</li>
<li>In “heavy-construction” states the crime rate increased by 167%; in “low-construction” states the crime rate increased by 145%.</li>

<div id="the-pros-and-cons-of-correlation" class="section level3">
<h3>The Pros and Cons of Correlation</h3>
<p>Pros:
- Nature gives you correlations for free.
- In principle, everyone can agree on the facts.</p>
<p>Cons:
- Correlations are not very helpful.
- They show what has happened, but not why.
- For many things, we care about why.</p>

<div id="uniting-social-science-and-computer-science" class="section level4">
<h4>Uniting Social Science and Computer Science</h4>
<p>We will start in this course by examining situations where we do <strong>not</strong> care about why something has happened, but instead we care about our ability to predict its occurrence from existing data.</p>
<p>(But of course keep in back of mind that if you are making policy, you must care about why something happened).</p>
<p>We will also borrow a few other ideas from CS:
- Anything is data
+ Satellite data
+ Unstructured text or audio
+ Facial expressions or vocal intonations
- Subtle improvements on existing techniques
- An eye towards practical implementability over ``cleanliness”</p>

<p>Small margins <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> huge payoffs. <span class="math inline">\(10\% \rightarrow\)</span> $1 million.</p>
<p>Not obvious to me why this was worth so much for Netflix (that’s an interesting research question). However, it’s quite obvious why this is true in financial markets.</p>

<h3>An Aside: Nomenclature</h3>
<p><strong>Machine learning</strong> arose as a subfield of Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>Statistical learning</strong> arose as a subfield of Statistics.</p>
<p>There is much overlap; however, a few points of distinction:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Machine learning has a greater emphasis on large scale applications and prediction accuracy.</p></li>
<li><p>Statistical learning emphasizes models and their interpretability, and precision and uncertainty.</p>
<ul>

<p><strong>ALERT</strong></p>
<p>The course content below should be considered a prerequisite for success. For those concerned about basics of <code>R</code>, you absolutely must read this content and attempt the coding exercises. If you struggle to follow the content, please contact the professor or TA.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="r-basics" class="section level1">
<h1><code>R</code> basics</h1>
<p>In this class, we will be using <code>R</code> software environment for all our analyses. You will learn <code>R</code> and data analysis techniques simultaneously. To follow along you will therefore need access to <code>R</code>. We also recommend the use of an <em>integrated development environment</em> (IDE), such as RStudio, to save your work.
Note that it is common for a course or workshop to offer access to an <code>R</code> environment and an IDE through your web browser, as done by RStudio cloud<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. If you have access to such a resource, you don’t need to install <code>R</code> and RStudio. However, if you intend on becoming a practicing data analyst, we highly recommend installing these tools on your computer<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. This is not hard.</p>
<p>Both <code>R</code> and RStudio are free and available online.</p>
<div id="case-study-us-homicides-by-firearm" class="section level2">
<h2>Case study: US homicides by firearm</h2>
<p>Imagine you live in Europe (if only!) and are offered a job in a US company with many locations in every state. It is a great job, but headlines such as <strong>US Gun Homicide Rate Higher Than Other Developed Countries</strong><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> have you worried. Fox News runs a scary looking graphic, and charts like the one below only add to that concern:</p>
<p><img src="/content/01-content_files/figure-html/murder-rate-example-1-1.png" width="70%" /></p>
<!--(Source:
[Ma’ayan Rosenzweigh/ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/12/us-gun-ownership-homicide-rate-higher-than-other-developed-countries/), Data from UNODC Homicide Statistics) -->
<p>Or even worse, this version from <a href="https://everytownresearch.org">everytown.org</a>:
<img src="/content/01-content_files/figure-html/murder-rate-example-2-1.png" width="70%" />
<!--(Source  [everytown.org](https://everytownresearch.org))--></p>
<p>But then you remember that (1) this is a hypothetical exercise; (2) you’ll take literally any job at this point; and (3) Geographic diversity matters – the United States is a large and diverse country with 50 very different states (plus the District of Columbia and some lovely territories).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<pre><code>## Warning: It is deprecated to specify `guide = FALSE` to remove a guide. Please
## use `guide = &quot;none&quot;` instead.</code></pre>
<p><img src="/content/01-content_files/figure-html/us-murders-by-state-map-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>California, for example, has a larger population than Canada, and 20 US states have populations larger than that of Norway. In some respects, the variability across states in the US is akin to the variability across countries in Europe. Furthermore, although not included in the charts above, the murder rates in Lithuania, Ukraine, and Russia are higher than 4 per 100,000. So perhaps the news reports that worried you are too superficial.</p>
<p>This is a relatively simple and straightforward problem in social science: you have options of where to live, and want to determine the safety of the various states. Your “research” is clearly policy-relevant: you will eventually have to live somewhere. We will begin to tackle the problem by examining data related to gun homicides in the US during 2010 using <code>R</code>.</p>
<p>Before we get started with our example, we need to cover logistics as well as some of the very basic building blocks that are required to gain more advanced <code>R</code> skills. Ideally, this is a refresher. However, we are aware that your preparation in previously courses varies greatly from student to student. Moreover, we want you to be aware that the usefulness of some of these early building blocks may not be immediately obvious. Later in the class you will appreciate having these skills. Mastery will be rewarded both in this class and (of course) in life.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-very-basics" class="section level2">
<h2>The (very) basics</h2>
<p>Before we get started with the motivating dataset, we need to cover the very basics of <code>R</code>.</p>
<div id="objects" class="section level3">
<h3>Objects</h3>
<p>Suppose a relatively math unsavvy student asks us for help solving several quadratic equations of the form <span class="math inline">\(ax^2+bx+c = 0\)</span>. You—a savvy student—recall that the quadratic formula gives us the solutions:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\,\, \mbox{ and } \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]</span></p>
<p>which of course depend on the values of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. That is, the quadratic equation represents a <em>function</em> with three <em>arguments</em>.</p>
<p>One advantage of programming languages is that we can define variables and write expressions with these variables, similar to how we do so in math, but obtain a numeric solution. We will write out general code for the quadratic equation below, but if we are asked to solve <span class="math inline">\(x^2 + x -1 = 0\)</span>, then we define:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>a &lt;- 1
b &lt;- 1
c &lt;- -1</code></pre>
<p>which stores the values for later use. We use <code>&lt;-</code> to assign values to the variables.</p>
<p>We can also assign values using <code>=</code> instead of <code>&lt;-</code>, but we recommend against using <code>=</code> to avoid confusion.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<div class="fyi">
<p><strong>TRY IT</strong></p>
<p>Copy and paste the code above into your console to define the three variables. Note that <code>R</code> does not print anything when we make this assignment. This means the objects were defined successfully. Had you made a mistake, you would have received an error message. Throughout these written notes, you’ll have the most success if you continue to copy code into your own console.</p>
</div>
<p>To see the value stored in a variable, we simply ask <code>R</code> to evaluate <code>a</code> and it shows the stored value:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>a</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1</code></pre>
<p>A more explicit way to ask <code>R</code> to show us the value stored in <code>a</code> is using <code>print</code> like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>print(a)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1</code></pre>
<p>We use the term <em>object</em> to describe stuff that is stored in <code>R</code>. Variables are examples, but objects can also be more complicated entities such as functions, which are described later.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-workspace" class="section level3">
<h3>The workspace</h3>
<p>As we define objects in the console, we are actually changing the <em>workspace</em>. You can see all the variables saved in your workspace by typing:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ls()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;a&quot;       &quot;b&quot;       &quot;c&quot;       &quot;dat&quot;     &quot;filter&quot;  &quot;murders&quot; &quot;select&quot;</code></pre>
<p>(Note that one of <em>my</em> variables listed above comes from generating the graphs above). In RStudio, the <em>Environment</em> tab shows the values:</p>
<p><img src="/img/rstudio-environment.png" /></p>
<p>We should see <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>. If you try to recover the value of a variable that is not in your workspace, you receive an error. For example, if you type <code>x</code> you will receive the following message: <code>Error: object 'x' not found</code>.</p>
<p>Now since these values are saved in variables, to obtain a solution to our equation, we use the quadratic formula:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>(-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c) ) / ( 2*a )</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.618034</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>(-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c) ) / ( 2*a )</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] -1.618034</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="functions" class="section level3">
<h3>Functions</h3>
<p>Once you define variables, the data analysis process can usually be described as a series of <em>functions</em> applied to the data. <code>R</code> includes several zillion predefined functions and most of the analysis pipelines we construct make extensive use of the built-in functions. But <code>R</code>’s power comes from its scalability. We have access to (nearly) infinite functions via <code>install.packages</code> and <code>library</code>. As we go through the course, we will carefully note new functions we bring to each problem. For now, though, we will stick to the basics.</p>
<p>Note that you’ve used a function already: you used the function <code>sqrt</code> to solve the quadratic equation above. These functions do not appear in the workspace because you did not define them, but they are available for immediate use.</p>
<p>In general, we need to use parentheses to evaluate a function. If you type <code>ls</code>, the function is not evaluated and instead <code>R</code> shows you the code that defines the function. If you type <code>ls()</code> the function is evaluated and, as seen above, we see objects in the workspace.</p>
<p>Unlike <code>ls</code>, most functions require one or more <em>arguments</em>. Below is an example of how we assign an object to the argument of the function <code>log</code>. Remember that we earlier defined <code>a</code> to be 1:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>log(8)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 2.079442</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>log(a)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0</code></pre>
<p>You can find out what the function expects and what it does by reviewing the very useful manuals included in <code>R</code>. You can get help by using the <code>help</code> function like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>help(&quot;log&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>For most functions, we can also use this shorthand:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>?log</code></pre>
<p>The help page will show you what arguments the function is expecting. For example, <code>log</code> needs <code>x</code> and <code>base</code> to run. However, some arguments are required and others are optional. You can determine which arguments are optional by noting in the help document that a default value is assigned with <code>=</code>. Defining these is optional.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> For example, the base of the function <code>log</code> defaults to <code>base = exp(1)</code>—that is, <code>log</code> evaluates the natural log by default.</p>
<p>If you want a quick look at the arguments without opening the help system, you can type:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>args(log)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## function (x, base = exp(1)) 
## NULL</code></pre>
<p>You can change the default values by simply assigning another object:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>log(8, base = 2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3</code></pre>
<p>Note that we have not been specifying the argument <code>x</code> as such:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>log(x = 8, base = 2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3</code></pre>
<p>The above code works, but we can save ourselves some typing: if no argument name is used, <code>R</code> assumes you are entering arguments in the order shown in the help file or by <code>args</code>. So by not using the names, it assumes the arguments are <code>x</code> followed by <code>base</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>log(8,2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3</code></pre>
<p>If using the arguments’ names, then we can include them in whatever order we want:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>log(base = 2, x = 8)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3</code></pre>
<p>To specify arguments, we must use <code>=</code>, and cannot use <code>&lt;-</code>.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to the rule that functions need the parentheses to be evaluated. Among these, the most commonly used are the arithmetic and relational operators. For example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>2 ^ 3</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 8</code></pre>
<p>You can see the arithmetic operators by typing:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>help(&quot;+&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre class="r"><code>?&quot;+&quot;</code></pre>
<p>and the relational operators by typing:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>help(&quot;&gt;&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre class="r"><code>?&quot;&gt;&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="other-prebuilt-objects" class="section level3">
<h3>Other prebuilt objects</h3>
<p>There are several datasets that are included for users to practice and test out functions. You can see all the available datasets by typing:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data()</code></pre>
<p>This shows you the object name for these datasets. These datasets are objects that can be used by simply typing the name. For example, if you type:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>co2</code></pre>
<p><code>R</code> will show you Mauna Loa atmospheric <span class="math inline">\(CO^2\)</span> concentration data.</p>
<p>Other prebuilt objects are mathematical quantities, such as the constant <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pi</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3.141593</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>Inf+1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] Inf</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="variable-names" class="section level3">
<h3>Variable names</h3>
<p>We have used the letters <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> as variable names, but variable names can be almost anything. Some basic rules in <code>R</code> are that variable names have to start with a letter, can’t contain spaces, and should not be variables that are predefined in <code>R</code>. For example, don’t name one of your variables <code>install.packages</code> by typing something like <code>install.packages &lt;- 2</code>. Usually, <code>R</code> is smart enough to prevent you from doing such nonsense, but it’s important to develop good habits.</p>
<p>A nice convention to follow is to use meaningful words that describe what is stored, use only lower case, and use underscores as a substitute for spaces. For the quadratic equations, we could use something like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>solution_1 &lt;- (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
solution_2 &lt;- (-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)</code></pre>
<p>For more advice, we highly recommend studying (Hadley Wickham’s style guide)[<a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html" class="uri">http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html</a>].</p>

<div id="saving-your-workspace" class="section level3">
<h3>Saving your workspace</h3>
<p>Values remain in the workspace until you end your session or erase them with the function <code>rm</code>. But workspaces also can be saved for later use. In fact, when you quit R, the program asks you if you want to save your workspace. If you do save it, the next time you start R, the program will restore the workspace.</p>
<p>We actually recommend against saving the workspace this way because, as you start working on different projects, it will become harder to keep track of what is saved. Instead, we recommend you assign the workspace a specific name. You can do this by using the function <code>save</code> or <code>save.image</code>. To load, use the function <code>load</code>. When saving a workspace, we recommend the suffix <code>rda</code> or <code>RData</code>. In RStudio, you can also do this by navigating to the <em>Session</em> tab and choosing <em>Save Workspace as</em>. You can later load it using the <em>Load Workspace</em> options in the same tab.
You can read the help pages on <code>save</code>, <code>save.image</code>, and <code>load</code> to learn more.</p>

<div id="motivating-scripts" class="section level3">
<h3>Motivating scripts</h3>
<p>To solve another equation such as <span class="math inline">\(3x^2 + 2x -1\)</span>, we can copy and paste the code above and then redefine the variables and recompute the solution:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>a &lt;- 3
b &lt;- 2
c &lt;- -1
(-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
(-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)</code></pre>
<p>By creating and saving a script with the code above, we would not need to retype everything each time and, instead, simply change the variable names. Try writing the script above into an editor and notice how easy it is to change the variables and receive an answer.</p>
</div>
<div id="commenting-your-code" class="section level3">
<h3>Commenting your code</h3>
<p>If a line of <code>R</code> code starts with the symbol <code>#</code>, it is not evaluated. We can use this to write reminders of why we wrote particular code. For example, in the script above we could add:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## Code to compute solution to quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c
## define the variables
a &lt;- 3
b &lt;- 2
c &lt;- -1

## now compute the solution

<div id="data-types" class="section level2">
<h2>Data types</h2>
<p>Variables in <code>R</code> can be of different types. For example, we need to distinguish numbers from character strings and tables from simple lists of numbers. The function <code>class</code> helps us determine what type of object we have:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>a &lt;- 2
class(a)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;numeric&quot;</code></pre>
<p>To work efficiently in R, it is important to learn the different types of variables and what we can do with these.</p>
<div id="data-frames" class="section level3">
<h3>Data frames</h3>
<p>Up to now, the variables we have defined are just one number. This is not very useful for storing data. The most common way of storing a dataset in <code>R</code> is in a <em>data frame</em>. Conceptually, we can think of a data frame as a table with rows representing observations and the different variables reported for each observation defining the columns. Data frames are particularly useful for datasets because we can combine different data types into one object.</p>
<p>A large proportion of data analysis challenges start with data stored in a data frame. For example, we stored the data for our motivating example in a data frame. You can access this dataset by loading the <strong>dslabs</strong> library and loading the <code>murders</code> dataset using the <code>data</code> function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dslabs)
data(murders)</code></pre>
<p>To see that this is in fact a data frame, we type:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>class(murders)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="examining-an-object" class="section level3">
<h3>Examining an object</h3>
<p>The function <code>str</code> is useful for finding out more about the structure of an object:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>str(murders)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## &#39;data.frame&#39;:    51 obs. of  5 variables:
## $ state : chr &quot;Alabama&quot; &quot;Alaska&quot; &quot;Arizona&quot; &quot;Arkansas&quot; ...
## $ abb : chr &quot;AL&quot; &quot;AK&quot; &quot;AZ&quot; &quot;AR&quot; ...
## $ region : Factor w/ 4 levels &quot;Northeast&quot;,&quot;South&quot;,..: 2 4 4 2 4 4 1 2 2 2 ...
## $ population: num 4779736 710231 6392017 2915918 37253956 ...
## $ total : num 135 19 232 93 1257 ...</code></pre>
<p>This tells us much more about the object. We see that the table has 51 rows (50 states plus DC) and five variables. We can show the first six lines using the function <code>head</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(murders)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##        state abb region population total
## 1    Alabama  AL  South    4779736   135
## 2     Alaska  AK   West     710231    19
## 3    Arizona  AZ   West    6392017   232
## 4   Arkansas  AR  South    2915918    93
## 5 California  CA   West   37253956  1257
## 6   Colorado  CO   West    5029196    65</code></pre>
<p>In this dataset, each state is considered an observation and five variables are reported for each state.</p>
<p>Before we go any further in answering our original question about different states, let’s learn more about the components of this object.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-accessor" class="section level3">
<h3>The accessor: <code>$</code></h3>
<p>For our analysis, we will need to access the different variables represented by columns included in this data frame. To do this, we use the accessor operator <code>$</code> in the following way:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>murders$population</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  4779736   710231  6392017  2915918 37253956  5029196  3574097   897934
##  [9]   601723 19687653  9920000  1360301  1567582 12830632  6483802  3046355
## [17]  2853118  4339367  4533372  1328361  5773552  6547629  9883640  5303925
## [25]  2967297  5988927   989415  1826341  2700551  1316470  8791894  2059179
## [33] 19378102  9535483   672591 11536504  3751351  3831074 12702379  1052567
## [41]  4625364   814180  6346105 25145561  2763885   625741  8001024  6724540
## [49]  1852994  5686986   563626</code></pre>
<p>But how did we know to use <code>population</code>? Previously, by applying the function <code>str</code> to the object <code>murders</code>, we revealed the names for each of the five variables stored in this table. We can quickly access the variable names using:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>names(murders)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;state&quot;      &quot;abb&quot;        &quot;region&quot;     &quot;population&quot; &quot;total&quot;</code></pre>
<p>It is important to know that the order of the entries in <code>murders$population</code> preserves the order of the rows in our data table. This will later permit us to manipulate one variable based on the results of another. For example, we will be able to order the state names by the number of murders.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: <code>R</code> comes with a very nice auto-complete functionality that saves us the trouble of typing out all the names. Try typing <code>murders$p</code> then hitting the <kbd>tab</kbd> key on your keyboard. This functionality and many other useful auto-complete features are available when working in RStudio.</p>
</div>
<div id="vectors-numerics-characters-and-logical" class="section level3">
<h3>Vectors: numerics, characters, and logical</h3>
<p>The object <code>murders$population</code> is not one number but several. We call these types of objects <em>vectors</em>. A single number is technically a vector of length 1, but in general we use the term vectors to refer to objects with several entries. The function <code>length</code> tells you how many entries are in the vector:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pop &lt;- murders$population
length(pop)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 51</code></pre>
<p>This particular vector is <em>numeric</em> since population sizes are numbers:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>class(pop)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;numeric&quot;</code></pre>
<p>In a numeric vector, every entry must be a number.</p>
<p>To store character strings, vectors can also be of class <em>character</em>. For example, the state names are characters:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>class(murders$state)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;character&quot;</code></pre>
<p>As with numeric vectors, all entries in a character vector need to be a character.</p>
<p>Another important type of vectors are <em>logical vectors</em>. These must be either <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>z &lt;- 3 == 2
z</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>class(z)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;logical&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Here the <code>==</code> is a relational operator asking if 3 is equal to 2. In <code>R</code>, if you just use one <code>=</code>, you actually assign a variable, but if you use two <code>==</code> you test for equality. Yet another reason to avoid assigning via <code>=</code>… it can get confusing and typos can really mess things up.</p>
<p>You can see the other <em>relational operators</em> by typing:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>?Comparison</code></pre>
<p>In future sections, you will see how useful relational operators can be.</p>
<p>We discuss more important features of vectors after the next set of exercises.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced</strong>: Mathematically, the values in <code>pop</code> are integers and there is an integer class in <code>R</code>. However, by default, numbers are assigned class numeric even when they are round integers. For example, <code>class(1)</code> returns numeric. You can turn them into class integer with the <code>as.integer()</code> function or by adding an <code>L</code> like this: <code>1L</code>. Note the class by typing: <code>class(1L)</code></p>
</div>
<div id="factors" class="section level3">
<h3>Factors</h3>
<p>In the <code>murders</code> dataset, we might expect the region to also be a character vector. However, it is not:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>class(murders$region)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;factor&quot;</code></pre>
<p>It is a <em>factor</em>. Factors are useful for storing categorical data. We can see that there are only 4 regions by using the <code>levels</code> function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>levels(murders$region)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Northeast&quot;     &quot;South&quot;         &quot;North Central&quot; &quot;West&quot;</code></pre>
<p>In the background, <code>R</code> stores these <em>levels</em> as integers and keeps a map to keep track of the labels. This is more memory efficient than storing all the characters. It is also useful for computational reasons we’ll explore later.</p>
<p>Note that the levels have an order that is different from the order of appearance in the factor object. The default in <code>R</code> is for the levels to follow alphabetical order. However, often we want the levels to follow a different order. You can specify an order through the <code>levels</code> argument when creating the factor with the <code>factor</code> function. For example, in the murders dataset regions are ordered from east to west. The function <code>reorder</code> lets us change the order of the levels of a factor variable based on a summary computed on a numeric vector. We will demonstrate this with a simple example, and will see more advanced ones in the Data Visualization part of the book.</p>
<p>Suppose we want the levels of the region by the total number of murders rather than alphabetical order. If there are values associated with each level, we can use the <code>reorder</code> and specify a data summary to determine the order. The following code takes the sum of the total murders in each region, and reorders the factor following these sums.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>region &lt;- murders$region
value &lt;- murders$total
region &lt;- reorder(region, value, FUN = sum)
levels(region)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Northeast&quot;     &quot;North Central&quot; &quot;West&quot;          &quot;South&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The new order is in agreement with the fact that the Northeast has the least murders and the South has the most.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: Factors can be a source of confusion since sometimes they behave like characters and sometimes they do not. As a result, confusing factors and characters are a common source of bugs.</p>
</div>
<div id="lists" class="section level3">
<h3>Lists</h3>
<p>Data frames are a special case of <em>lists</em>. We will cover lists in more detail later, but know that they are useful because you can store any combination of different types. Below is an example of a list we created for you:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>record</code></pre>
<pre><code>## $name
## [1] &quot;John Doe&quot;
## 
## $student_id
## [1] 1234
## 
## $grades
## [1] 95 82 91 97 93
## 
## $final_grade
## [1] &quot;A&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>class(record)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;list&quot;</code></pre>
<p>As with data frames, you can extract the components of a list with the accessor <code>$</code>. In fact, data frames are a type of list.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>record$student_id</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1234</code></pre>
<p>We can also use double square brackets (<code>[[</code>) like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>record[[&quot;student_id&quot;]]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1234</code></pre>
<p>You should get used to the fact that in <code>R</code> there are often several ways to do the same thing. such as accessing entries.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>You might also encounter lists without variable names.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>record2</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [[1]]
## [1] &quot;John Doe&quot;
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 1234</code></pre>
<p>If a list does not have names, you cannot extract the elements with <code>$</code>, but you can still use the brackets method and instead of providing the variable name, you provide the list index, like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>record2[[1]]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;John Doe&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We won’t be using lists until later, but you might encounter one in your own exploration of <code>R</code>. For this reason, we show you some basics here.</p>
</div>
<div id="matrices" class="section level3">
<h3>Matrices</h3>
<p>Matrices are another type of object that are common in <code>R</code>. Matrices are similar to data frames in that they are two-dimensional: they have rows and columns. However, like numeric, character and logical vectors, entries in matrices have to be all the same type. For this reason data frames are much more useful for storing data, since we can have characters, factors, and numbers in them.</p>
<p>Yet matrices have a major advantage over data frames: we can perform matrix algebra operations, a powerful type of mathematical technique. We do not describe these operations in this class, but much of what happens in the background when you perform a data analysis involves matrices. We describe them briefly here since some of the functions we will learn return matrices.</p>
<p>We can define a matrix using the <code>matrix</code> function. We need to specify the number of rows and columns.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mat &lt;- matrix(1:12, 4, 3)
mat</code></pre>
<pre><code>##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    1    5    9
## [2,]    2    6   10
## [3,]    3    7   11
## [4,]    4    8   12</code></pre>
<p>You can access specific entries in a matrix using square brackets (<code>[</code>). If you want the second row, third column, you use:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mat[2, 3]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 10</code></pre>
<p>If you want the entire second row, you leave the column spot empty:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mat[2, ]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1]  2  6 10</code></pre>
<p>Notice that this returns a vector, not a matrix.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you want the entire third column, you leave the row spot empty:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mat[, 3]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1]  9 10 11 12</code></pre>
<p>This is also a vector, not a matrix.</p>
<p>You can access more than one column or more than one row if you like. This will give you a new matrix.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mat[, 2:3]</code></pre>
<pre><code>##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    5    9
## [2,]    6   10
## [3,]    7   11
## [4,]    8   12</code></pre>
<p>You can subset both rows and columns:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mat[1:2, 2:3]</code></pre>
<pre><code>##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    5    9
## [2,]    6   10</code></pre>
<p>We can convert matrices into data frames using the function <code>as.data.frame</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>as.data.frame(mat)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   V1 V2 V3
## 1  1  5  9
## 2  2  6 10
## 3  3  7 11
## 4  4  8 12</code></pre>
<p>You can also use single square brackets (<code>[</code>) to access rows and columns of a data frame:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data(&quot;murders&quot;)
murders[25, 1]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Mississippi&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>murders[2:3, ]</code></pre>

<div id="vectors" class="section level2">
<h2>Vectors</h2>
<p>In R, the most basic objects available to store data are <em>vectors</em>. As we have seen, complex datasets can usually be broken down into components that are vectors. For example, in a data frame, each column is a vector. Here we learn more about this important class.</p>
<div id="creating-vectors" class="section level3">
<h3>Creating vectors</h3>
<p>We can create vectors using the function <code>c</code>, which stands for <em>concatenate</em>. We use <code>c</code> to concatenate entries in the following way:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>codes &lt;- c(380, 124, 818)
codes</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 380 124 818</code></pre>
<p>We can also create character vectors. We use the quotes to denote that the entries are characters rather than variable names.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>country &lt;- c(&quot;italy&quot;, &quot;canada&quot;, &quot;egypt&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>In <code>R</code> you can also use single quotes:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>country &lt;- c(&#39;italy&#39;, &#39;canada&#39;, &#39;egypt&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>But be careful not to confuse the single quote ’ with the <em>back quote</em>, which shares a keyboard key with <kbd>~</kbd>.</p>
<p>By now you should know that if you type:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>country &lt;- c(italy, canada, egypt)</code></pre>
<p>you receive an error because the variables <code>italy</code>, <code>canada</code>, and <code>egypt</code> are not defined. If we do not use the quotes, <code>R</code> looks for variables with those names and returns an error.</p>
</div>
<div id="names" class="section level3">
<h3>Names</h3>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to name the entries of a vector. For example, when defining a vector of country codes, we can use the names to connect the two:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>codes &lt;- c(italy = 380, canada = 124, egypt = 818)
codes</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  italy canada  egypt 
##    380    124    818</code></pre>
<p>The object <code>codes</code> continues to be a numeric vector:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>class(codes)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;numeric&quot;</code></pre>
<p>but with names:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>names(codes)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;italy&quot;  &quot;canada&quot; &quot;egypt&quot;</code></pre>
<p>If the use of strings without quotes looks confusing, know that you can use the quotes as well:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>codes &lt;- c(&quot;italy&quot; = 380, &quot;canada&quot; = 124, &quot;egypt&quot; = 818)
codes</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  italy canada  egypt 
##    380    124    818</code></pre>
<p>There is no difference between this function call and the previous one. This is one of the many ways in which <code>R</code> is quirky compared to other languages.</p>
<p>We can also assign names using the <code>names</code> functions:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>codes &lt;- c(380, 124, 818)
country &lt;- c(&quot;italy&quot;,&quot;canada&quot;,&quot;egypt&quot;)
names(codes) &lt;- country
codes</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  italy canada  egypt 
##    380    124    818</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="sequences" class="section level3">
<h3>Sequences</h3>
<p>Another useful function for creating vectors generates sequences:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>seq(1, 10)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10</code></pre>
<p>The first argument defines the start, and the second defines the end which is included. The default is to go up in increments of 1, but a third argument lets us tell it how much to jump by:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>seq(1, 10, 2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1 3 5 7 9</code></pre>
<p>If we want consecutive integers, we can use the following shorthand:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>1:10</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10</code></pre>
<p>When we use these functions, <code>R</code> produces integers, not numerics, because they are typically used to index something:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>class(1:10)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;integer&quot;</code></pre>
<p>However, if we create a sequence including non-integers, the class changes:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>class(seq(1, 10, 0.5))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;numeric&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="subsetting" class="section level3">
<h3>Subsetting</h3>
<p>We use square brackets to access specific elements of a vector. For the vector <code>codes</code> we defined above, we can access the second element using:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>codes[2]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## canada 
##    124</code></pre>
<p>You can get more than one entry by using a multi-entry vector as an index:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>codes[c(1,3)]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## italy egypt 
##   380   818</code></pre>
<p>The sequences defined above are particularly useful if we want to access, say, the first two elements:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>codes[1:2]</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  italy canada 
##    380    124</code></pre>
<p>If the elements have names, we can also access the entries using these names. Below are two examples.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>codes[&quot;canada&quot;]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## canada 
##    124</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>codes[c(&quot;egypt&quot;,&quot;italy&quot;)]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## egypt italy 
##   818   380</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="coercion" class="section level2">
<h2>Coercion</h2>
<p>In general, <em>coercion</em> is an attempt by <code>R</code> to be flexible with data types. When an entry does not match the expected, some of the prebuilt <code>R</code> functions try to guess what was meant before throwing an error. This can also lead to confusion. Failing to understand <em>coercion</em> can drive programmers crazy when attempting to code in <code>R</code> since it behaves quite differently from most other languages in this regard. Let’s learn about it with some examples.</p>
<p>We said that vectors must be all of the same type. So if we try to combine, say, numbers and characters, you might expect an error:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- c(1, &quot;canada&quot;, 3)</code></pre>
<p>But we don’t get one, not even a warning! What happened? Look at <code>x</code> and its class:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;1&quot;      &quot;canada&quot; &quot;3&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>class(x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;character&quot;</code></pre>
<p>R <em>coerced</em> the data into characters. It guessed that because you put a character string in the vector, you meant the 1 and 3 to actually be character strings <code>"1"</code> and “<code>3</code>”. The fact that not even a warning is issued is an example of how coercion can cause many unnoticed errors in <code>R</code>.</p>
<p>R also offers functions to change from one type to another. For example, you can turn numbers into characters with:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- 1:5
y &lt;- as.character(x)
y</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; &quot;5&quot;</code></pre>
<p>You can turn it back with <code>as.numeric</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>as.numeric(y)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1 2 3 4 5</code></pre>
<p>This function is actually quite useful since datasets that include numbers as character strings are common.</p>
<div id="not-availables-na" class="section level3">
<h3>Not availables (NA)</h3>
<p>This “topic” seems to be wholly unappreciated and it has been our experience that students often panic when encountering an <code>NA</code>. This often happens when a function tries to coerce one type to another and encounters an impossible case. In such circumstances, <code>R</code> usually gives us a warning and turns the entry into a special value called an <code>NA</code> (for “not available”). For example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- c(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;3&quot;)
as.numeric(x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1]  1 NA  3</code></pre>
<p>R does not have any guesses for what number you want when you type <code>b</code>, so it does not try.</p>
<p>While coercion is a common case leading to <code>NA</code>s, you’ll see them in nearly every real-world dataset. Most often, you will encounter the <code>NA</code>s as a stand-in for missing data. Again, this a common problem in real-world datasets and you need to be aware that it will come up.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="sorting" class="section level2">
<h2>Sorting</h2>
<p>Now that we have mastered some basic <code>R</code> knowledge (ha!), let’s try to gain some insights into the safety of different states in the context of gun murders.</p>
<div id="sort" class="section level3">
<h3><code>sort</code></h3>
<p>Say we want to rank the states from least to most gun murders. The function <code>sort</code> sorts a vector in increasing order. We can therefore see the largest number of gun murders by typing:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dslabs)
data(murders)
sort(murders$total)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]    2    4    5    5    7    8   11   12   12   16   19   21   22   27   32
## [16]   36   38   53   63   65   67   84   93   93   97   97   99  111  116  118
## [31]  120  135  142  207  219  232  246  250  286  293  310  321  351  364  376
## [46]  413  457  517  669  805 1257</code></pre>
<p>However, this does not give us information about which states have which murder totals. For example, we don’t know which state had 1257.</p>
</div>
<div id="order" class="section level3">
<h3><code>order</code></h3>
<p>The function <code>order</code> is closer to what we want. It takes a vector as input and returns the vector of indexes that sorts the input vector. This may sound confusing so let’s look at a simple example. We can create a vector and sort it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- c(31, 4, 15, 92, 65)
sort(x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1]  4 15 31 65 92</code></pre>
<p>Rather than sort the input vector, the function <code>order</code> returns the index that sorts input vector:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>index &lt;- order(x)
x[index]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1]  4 15 31 65 92</code></pre>
<p>This is the same output as that returned by <code>sort(x)</code>. If we look at this index, we see why it works:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 31  4 15 92 65</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>order(x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 2 3 1 5 4</code></pre>
<p>The second entry of <code>x</code> is the smallest, so <code>order(x)</code> starts with <code>2</code>. The next smallest is the third entry, so the second entry is <code>3</code> and so on.</p>
<p>How does this help us order the states by murders? First, remember that the entries of vectors you access with <code>$</code> follow the same order as the rows in the table. For example, these two vectors containing state names and abbreviations, respectively, are matched by their order:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>murders$state[1:6]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Alabama&quot;    &quot;Alaska&quot;     &quot;Arizona&quot;    &quot;Arkansas&quot;   &quot;California&quot;
## [6] &quot;Colorado&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>murders$abb[1:6]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;AL&quot; &quot;AK&quot; &quot;AZ&quot; &quot;AR&quot; &quot;CA&quot; &quot;CO&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This means we can order the state names by their total murders. We first obtain the index that orders the vectors according to murder totals and then index the state names vector:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ind &lt;- order(murders$total)
murders$abb[ind]</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] &quot;VT&quot; &quot;ND&quot; &quot;NH&quot; &quot;WY&quot; &quot;HI&quot; &quot;SD&quot; &quot;ME&quot; &quot;ID&quot; &quot;MT&quot; &quot;RI&quot; &quot;AK&quot; &quot;IA&quot; &quot;UT&quot; &quot;WV&quot; &quot;NE&quot;
## [16] &quot;OR&quot; &quot;DE&quot; &quot;MN&quot; &quot;KS&quot; &quot;CO&quot; &quot;NM&quot; &quot;NV&quot; &quot;AR&quot; &quot;WA&quot; &quot;CT&quot; &quot;WI&quot; &quot;DC&quot; &quot;OK&quot; &quot;KY&quot; &quot;MA&quot;
## [31] &quot;MS&quot; &quot;AL&quot; &quot;IN&quot; &quot;SC&quot; &quot;TN&quot; &quot;AZ&quot; &quot;NJ&quot; &quot;VA&quot; &quot;NC&quot; &quot;MD&quot; &quot;OH&quot; &quot;MO&quot; &quot;LA&quot; &quot;IL&quot; &quot;GA&quot;
## [46] &quot;MI&quot; &quot;PA&quot; &quot;NY&quot; &quot;FL&quot; &quot;TX&quot; &quot;CA&quot;</code></pre>
<p>According to the above, California had the most murders.</p>
</div>
<div id="max-and-which.max" class="section level3">
<h3><code>max</code> and <code>which.max</code></h3>
<p>If we are only interested in the entry with the largest value, we can use <code>max</code> for the value:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>max(murders$total)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1257</code></pre>
<p>and <code>which.max</code> for the index of the largest value:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>i_max &lt;- which.max(murders$total)
murders$state[i_max]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;California&quot;</code></pre>
<p>For the minimum, we can use <code>min</code> and <code>which.min</code> in the same way.</p>
<p>Does this mean California is the most dangerous state? In an upcoming section, we argue that we should be considering rates instead of totals. Before doing that, we introduce one last order-related function: <code>rank</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="rank" class="section level3">
<h3><code>rank</code></h3>
<p>Although not as frequently used as <code>order</code> and <code>sort</code>, the function <code>rank</code> is also related to order and can be useful.
For any given vector it returns a vector with the rank of the first entry, second entry, etc., of the input vector. Here is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- c(31, 4, 15, 92, 65)
rank(x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3 1 2 5 4</code></pre>
<p>To summarize, let’s look at the results of the three functions we have introduced:</p>

<h3>Beware of recycling</h3>
<p>Another common source of unnoticed errors in <code>R</code> is the use of <em>recycling</em>. We saw that vectors are added elementwise. So if the vectors don’t match in length, it is natural to assume that we should get an error. But we don’t. Notice what happens:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- c(1,2,3)
y &lt;- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70)

## length</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 11 22 33 41 52 63 71</code></pre>

<p><strong>TRY IT</strong></p>
<p>For these exercises we will use the US murders dataset. Make sure you load it prior to starting.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Use the <code>$</code> operator to access the population size data and store it as the object <code>pop</code>. Then use the <code>sort</code> function to redefine <code>pop</code> so that it is sorted. Finally, use the <code>[</code> operator to report the smallest population size.</p></li>
<li><p>Now instead of the smallest population size, find the index of the entry with the smallest population size. Hint: use <code>order</code> instead of <code>sort</code>.</p></li>

<h2>Vector arithmetics</h2>
<p>California had the most murders, but does this mean it is the most dangerous state? What if it just has many more people than any other state? We can quickly confirm that California indeed has the largest population:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dslabs)
data(&quot;murders&quot;)
murders$state[which.max(murders$population)]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;California&quot;</code></pre>
<p>with over 37 million inhabitants. It is therefore unfair to compare the totals if we are interested in learning how safe the state is. What we really should be computing is the murders per capita. The reports we describe in the motivating section used murders per 100,000 as the unit. To compute this quantity, the powerful vector arithmetic capabilities of <code>R</code> come in handy.</p>
<div id="rescaling-a-vector" class="section level3">
<h3>Rescaling a vector</h3>
<p>In R, arithmetic operations on vectors occur <em>element-wise</em>. For a quick example, suppose we have height in inches:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>inches &lt;- c(69, 62, 66, 70, 70, 73, 67, 73, 67, 70)</code></pre>
<p>and want to convert to centimeters. Notice what happens when we multiply <code>inches</code> by 2.54:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>inches * 2.54</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] 175.26 157.48 167.64 177.80 177.80 185.42 170.18 185.42 170.18 177.80</code></pre>
<p>In the line above, we multiplied each element by 2.54. Similarly, if for each entry we want to compute how many inches taller or shorter than 69 inches, the average height for males, we can subtract it from every entry like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>inches - 69</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  0 -7 -3  1  1  4 -2  4 -2  1</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="two-vectors" class="section level3">
<h3>Two vectors</h3>
<p>If we have two vectors of the same length, and we sum them in R, they will be added entry by entry as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{pmatrix}
a\\
b\\
c\\
d
\end{pmatrix}
+
\begin{pmatrix}
e\\
f\\
g\\
h
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
a +e\\
b + f\\
c + g\\
d + h
\end{pmatrix}
\]</span></p>
<p>The same holds for other mathematical operations, such as <code>-</code>, <code>*</code> and <code>/</code>.</p>
<p>This implies that to compute the murder rates we can simply type:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>murder_rate &lt;- murders$total / murders$population * 100000</code></pre>
<p>Once we do this, we notice that California is no longer near the top of the list. In fact, we can use what we have learned to order the states by murder rate:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>murders$abb[order(murder_rate)]</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] &quot;VT&quot; &quot;NH&quot; &quot;HI&quot; &quot;ND&quot; &quot;IA&quot; &quot;ID&quot; &quot;UT&quot; &quot;ME&quot; &quot;WY&quot; &quot;OR&quot; &quot;SD&quot; &quot;MN&quot; &quot;MT&quot; &quot;CO&quot; &quot;WA&quot;

<div id="indexing" class="section level2">
<h2>Indexing</h2>
<p>Indexing is a boring name for an important tool. <code>R</code> provides a powerful and convenient way of referencing specific elements of vectors. We can, for example, subset a vector based on properties of another vector. In this section, we continue working with our US murders example, which we can load like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dslabs)
data(&quot;murders&quot;)</code></pre>
<div id="subsetting-with-logicals" class="section level3">
<h3>Subsetting with logicals</h3>
<p>We have now calculated the murder rate using:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>murder_rate &lt;- murders$total / murders$population * 100000</code></pre>
<p>Imagine you are moving from Italy where, according to an ABC news report, the murder rate is only 0.71 per 100,000. You would prefer to move to a state with a similar murder rate. Another powerful feature of <code>R</code> is that we can use logicals to index vectors. If we compare a vector to a single number, it actually performs the test for each entry. The following is an example related to the question above:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ind &lt;- murder_rate &lt; 0.71</code></pre>
<p>If we instead want to know if a value is less or equal, we can use:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ind &lt;- murder_rate &lt;= 0.71</code></pre>
<p>Note that we get back a logical vector with <code>TRUE</code> for each entry smaller than or equal to 0.71. To see which states these are, we can leverage the fact that vectors can be indexed with logicals.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>murders$state[ind]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Hawaii&quot;        &quot;Iowa&quot;          &quot;New Hampshire&quot; &quot;North Dakota&quot; 
## [5] &quot;Vermont&quot;</code></pre>
<p>In order to count how many are TRUE, the function <code>sum</code> returns the sum of the entries of a vector and logical vectors get <em>coerced</em> to numeric with <code>TRUE</code> coded as 1 and <code>FALSE</code> as 0. Thus we can count the states using:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sum(ind)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 5</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="logical-operators" class="section level3">
<h3>Logical operators</h3>
<p>Suppose we like the mountains and we want to move to a safe state in the western region of the country. We want the murder rate to be at most 1. In this case, we want two different things to be true. Here we can use the logical operator <em>and</em>, which in <code>R</code> is represented with <code>&amp;</code>. This operation results in <code>TRUE</code> only when both logicals are <code>TRUE</code>. To see this, consider this example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>TRUE &amp; TRUE</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>TRUE &amp; FALSE</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>FALSE &amp; FALSE</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE</code></pre>
<p>For our example, we can form two logicals:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>west &lt;- murders$region == &quot;West&quot;
safe &lt;- murder_rate &lt;= 1</code></pre>
<p>and we can use the <code>&amp;</code> to get a vector of logicals that tells us which states satisfy both conditions:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ind &lt;- safe &amp; west
murders$state[ind]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Hawaii&quot;  &quot;Idaho&quot;   &quot;Oregon&quot;  &quot;Utah&quot;    &quot;Wyoming&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="which" class="section level3">
<h3><code>which</code></h3>
<p>Suppose we want to look up California’s murder rate. For this type of operation, it is convenient to convert vectors of logicals into indexes instead of keeping long vectors of logicals. The function <code>which</code> tells us which entries of a logical vector are TRUE. So we can type:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ind &lt;- which(murders$state == &quot;California&quot;)
murder_rate[ind]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3.374138</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="match" class="section level3">
<h3><code>match</code></h3>
<p>If instead of just one state we want to find out the murder rates for several states, say New York, Florida, and Texas, we can use the function <code>match</code>. This function tells us which indexes of a second vector match each of the entries of a first vector:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ind &lt;- match(c(&quot;New York&quot;, &quot;Florida&quot;, &quot;Texas&quot;), murders$state)
ind</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 33 10 44</code></pre>
<p>Now we can look at the murder rates:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>murder_rate[ind]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 2.667960 3.398069 3.201360</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="in" class="section level3">
<h3><code>%in%</code></h3>
<p>If rather than an index we want a logical that tells us whether or not each element of a first vector is in a second, we can use the function <code>%in%</code>. Let’s imagine you are not sure if Boston, Dakota, and Washington are states. You can find out like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>c(&quot;Boston&quot;, &quot;Dakota&quot;, &quot;Washington&quot;) %in% murders$state</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE</code></pre>
<p>Note that we will be using <code>%in%</code> often throughout the book.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced</strong>: There is a connection between <code>match</code> and <code>%in%</code> through <code>which</code>. To see this, notice that the following two lines produce the same index (although in different order):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>match(c(&quot;New York&quot;, &quot;Florida&quot;, &quot;Texas&quot;), murders$state)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 33 10 44</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>which(murders$state%in%c(&quot;New York&quot;, &quot;Florida&quot;, &quot;Texas&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 10 33 44</code></pre>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Compute the per 100,000 murder rate for each state and store it in an object called <code>murder_rate</code>. Then use logical operators to create a logical vector named <code>low</code> that tells us which entries of <code>murder_rate</code> are lower than 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Now use the results from the previous exercise and the function <code>which</code> to determine the indices of <code>murder_rate</code> associated with values lower than 1.</p></li>

<li><p>Now extend the code from exercises 2 and 3 to report the states in the Northeast with murder rates lower than 1. Hint: use the previously defined logical vector <code>low</code> and the logical operator <code>&amp;</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>In a previous exercise we computed the murder rate for each state and the average of these numbers. How many states are below the average?</p></li>
<li><p>Use the match function to identify the states with abbreviations AK, MI, and IA. Hint: start by defining an index of the entries of <code>murders$abb</code> that match the three abbreviations, then use the <code>[</code> operator to extract the states.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the <code>%in%</code> operator to create a logical vector that answers the question: which of the following are actual abbreviations: MA, ME, MI, MO, MU?</p></li>
<li><p>Extend the code you used in exercise 7 to report the one entry that is <strong>not</strong> an actual abbreviation. Hint: use the <code>!</code> operator, which turns <code>FALSE</code> into <code>TRUE</code> and vice versa, then <code>which</code> to obtain an index.</p></li>
