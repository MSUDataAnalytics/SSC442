<h2>Group Projects</h2>
<p>Your final is a group project.</p>
<p>You need to start planning soon.</p>
<p>To aid in your planning, here are the required elements of your project (<strong>note: the assignment that currently exists on this site, if you find it, is old and will change a lot between now and next week</strong>).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>You must find existing data to analyze. Aggregating and merging data from multiple sources is encouraged.</p></li>
<li><p>You must visualize 3 intersting features of that data.</p></li>
<li><p>You must come up with some analysis—using tools from this course—which relates your data to either a prediction or a policy conclusion.</p></li>
<li><p>You must think critically about your analysis and be able to identify potential issues/</p></li>
<li><p>You must present your analysis as if presenting to a C-suite executive.</p></li>
</ol>
<div id="teams" class="section level3">
<h3>Teams</h3>
<p>Please form teams of 2-4 and use the survey link I will send out via email to “establish” your teams.</p>
<p>If you opt to not form a team, you will be automatically added to the “willing to be randomly assigned” pool and will be paired with another person.</p>
<div id="more-on-your-team" class="section level4">
<h4>More on your team</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>You should strongly consider coordinating your work via Github</p></li>
<li><p>Your team will earn the same scores on all projects</p></li>
<li><p>Teams will submit only one write-up for the mini-projects and the final</p></li>

<div id="randomness-and-data-analytics" class="section level2">
<h2>Randomness and Data Analytics</h2>
<p>And the fabulous importance of probabilistic inference…</p>
<p>This lecture is very “high-level,” which means it is talking about abstract concepts. It is also quite important.</p>
<p>We want to discuss <strong>why</strong> we eventually will need ot utilize tons of difficult mathematics. Why do we care so much about hypothesis tests and the like?</p>
<p>Moreover, we can highlight why we want our data structured to behave nicely.</p>
<div id="learning-from-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Learning From Data</h3>
<p>The following are the baisc requirements for statistical learning</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>A pattern exists</p></li>
<li><p>This pattern is not easily expressed in a closed mathematical form</p></li>
<li><p>You have data</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="formalization" class="section level3">
<h3>Formalization</h3>
<p>We think of our outcome-of-interest as a <strong>reponse</strong> or <strong>target</strong> that we wish to predict or wish to learn something about.</p>
<p>We generically refer to the response as <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span></p>
<p>Other aspects of the data are known as <strong>features, inputs, predictors</strong>, or <strong>regressors</strong>. We call one of these <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The subscript <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> indicates that we have an <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> realized for every individual in our data</li>
</ul>
<p>We can refer to the input vector collectively as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[X = \begin{bmatrix} 
x_{11} &amp; x_{12} \\
x_{21} &amp; x_{22} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots \\
x_{N1} &amp; x_{N2}
\end{bmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p>We are seeking some unknown function that maps <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span></p>
<p>Put another way, we are seeking to explain <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y = f(X) + e\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="the-target-function" class="section level3">
<h3>The Target Function</h3>
<p>We call the function <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}\)</span> the <strong>target function</strong></p>
<p>How do we find the function? We don’t! We get as close as we can, though:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Observe data <span class="math inline">\((\mathbf{x}_1, y_1), \cdots, (\mathbf{x}_N, y_N)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Use some algorithm to approximate <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Produce final hypothesis function <span class="math inline">\(g \approx f\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate how well <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> approximates <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and iterate as needed.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="why-estimate-an-unknown-function" class="section level3">
<h3>Why Estimate an Unknown Function?</h3>
<p>With a good estimate of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> we can make predictions of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> at <strong>new</strong> points <span class="math inline">\(X = x\)</span></p>
<p>We can also understand which components of <span class="math inline">\(X = (X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_m)\)</span> are important in explaining <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, and which are (potentially) irrelevant</p>
<ul>
<li>e.g. <code>GDP</code> and <code>yearsindustrialized</code> have a big impact on <code>emissions</code> but <code>hydroutilization</code> typically does not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the complexity of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, we may be able to meaningfully understand how each component of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> affects <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
<p>(But we should be careful about assigning causal interpretations, more on this later)</p>
</div>
<div id="the-parable-of-the-marbles" class="section level3">
<h3>The Parable of the Marbles</h3>
<p>(Courtesy of Prof. Bushong)</p>
<p>Imagine a bag of marbles with two types of marbles: ♣️ and ♦️.</p>
<p>We are going to pick a <strong>sample</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> marbles (with replacement).</p>
<p>We want to learn something about <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, the <strong>objective</strong> probability to pick a ♣️.</p>
<p>In addition to defining the <strong>objective</strong> probability of picking a ♣️, we have an observed fraction <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>, which will define as the fraction of ♣️ in the <em>sample</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Can we say anything exact and for-sure about <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> (outside the data) after observing <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> (the data)?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No. It is possible for the sample to be all ♣️, ♣️, ♣️, ♣️, ♣️ even when the bag is is 50/50 ♦️</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No matter what we draw, we can’t (based on that draw alone) eliminate the possibility of drawing a ♦️.</p></li>
<li><p>And unless we assume that the only two values in the world are ♦️ and ♣️, we can’t rule out 💩<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Then why do we do things like polling (e.g. to predict the outcome of a presidential election)?</p>
<ul>
<li>The bad case, that we draw something that has is completely misleading, is <em>possible</em> but not <strong>probable</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="outside-the-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Outside the Data</h3>
<p>Put another way, since <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is unknown, it can take on any value outside the data we have, no matter how large the data.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is called <em>No Free Lunch</em></li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot know anything for sure about <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> outside the data without making assumptions.</p>
<p>Is there any hope to know anything about <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> outside the data set without making assumptions about <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>?</p>
<p><strong>Yes</strong>, if we are willing to give up the “for sure”</p>
</div>
<div id="hoeffdings-inequality" class="section level3">
<h3>Hoeffding’s Inequality</h3>
<p><strong>Hoeffding’s Inequality</strong> states, loosely, that <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> cannot be too far from <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathbb{P}\left[|\eta - \mu| &gt; \epsilon \right] \leq 2e^{-2\epsilon^2n}\]</span>
<span class="math inline">\(\eta \approx \mu\)</span> is called <strong>probably approximately correct</strong> (PAC) learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="an-example-of-hoeffdings-inequality" class="section level3">
<h3>An example of Hoeffding’s Inequality</h3>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: n = 1,000. Draw a sample and observe <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> 99% of the time, <span class="math inline">\(\mu - .05 \leq \eta \leq \mu+.05\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>This is implied by setting <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon = 0.05\)</span> and using <span class="math inline">\(n=1,000\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>99.9999996% of the time <span class="math inline">\(\mu - .10 \leq \eta \leq \mu + .10\%\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What does this mean?</strong></p>
<p>If I repeatedly pick a sample of size 1,000, observe <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> and claim that <span class="math inline">\(\mu \in \left[\eta - .05, \eta + .05\right]\)</span> (or that the error bar is <span class="math inline">\(\pm 0.05\)</span>), I will be right 99% of the time.</p>
<p>On any particular sample you may be wrong, but not often.</p>
<div class="fyi">
<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>
<p>This week’s content is split into two “halves”: the critical data manipulation information contained below and a more-entertaining discussion of visualization included in the Exercises.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="tidyverse" class="section level1">
<h1>The tidyverse</h1>
<p>In the first weeks’ content, we demonstrated how to manipulate vectors by reordering and subsetting them through indexing. However, once we start more advanced analyses, the preferred unit for data storage is not the vector but the data frame. In this lecture, we learn to work directly with data frames, which greatly facilitate the organization of information. We will be using data frames for the majority of this class and you will use them for the majority of your data science life (however long that might be). We will focus on a specific data format referred to as <em>tidy</em> and on specific collection of packages that are particularly helpful for working with <em>tidy</em> data referred to as the <em>tidyverse</em>.</p>
<p>We can load all the tidyverse packages at once by installing and loading the <strong>tidyverse</strong> package:<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<p>We will learn how to implement the tidyverse approach throughout the book, but before delving into the details, in this chapter we introduce some of the most widely used tidyverse functionality, starting with the <strong>dplyr</strong> package for manipulating data frames and the <strong>purrr</strong> package for working with functions. Note that the tidyverse also includes a graphing package, <strong>ggplot2</strong>, which we introduce later in Chapter <a href="#ggplot2"><strong>??</strong></a> in the Data Visualization part of the book; the <strong>readr</strong> package discussed in Chapter <a href="#importing-data"><strong>??</strong></a>; and many others. In this chapter, we first introduce the concept of <em>tidy data</em> and then demonstrate how we use the tidyverse to work with data frames in this format.</p>
<div id="tidy-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Tidy data</h2>
<p>We say that a data table is in <em>tidy</em> format if each row represents one observation and columns represent the different variables available for each of these observations. The <code>murders</code> dataset is an example of a tidy data frame.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dslabs)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: package &#39;dslabs&#39; was built under R version 4.0.5</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>data(murders)
head(murders)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##        state abb region population total
## 1    Alabama  AL  South    4779736   135
## 2     Alaska  AK   West     710231    19
## 3    Arizona  AZ   West    6392017   232
## 4   Arkansas  AR  South    2915918    93
## 5 California  CA   West   37253956  1257
## 6   Colorado  CO   West    5029196    65</code></pre>
<p>Each row represent a state with each of the five columns providing a different variable related to these states: name, abbreviation, region, population, and total murders.</p>
<p>To see how the same information can be provided in different formats, consider the following example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dslabs)
data(&quot;gapminder&quot;)
tidy_data &lt;- gapminder %&gt;%
  filter(country %in% c(&quot;South Korea&quot;, &quot;Germany&quot;) &amp; !is.na(fertility)) %&gt;%
  select(country, year, fertility)
head(tidy_data, 6)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##       country year fertility
## 1     Germany 1960      2.41
## 2 South Korea 1960      6.16
## 3     Germany 1961      2.44
## 4 South Korea 1961      5.99
## 5     Germany 1962      2.47
## 6 South Korea 1962      5.79</code></pre>
<p>This tidy dataset provides fertility rates for two countries across the years. This is a tidy dataset because each row presents one observation with the three variables being country, year, and fertility rate. However, this dataset originally came in another format and was reshaped for the <strong>dslabs</strong> package. Originally, the data was in the following format:</p>
<pre><code>##       country 1960 1961 1962
## 1     Germany 2.41 2.44 2.47
## 2 South Korea 6.16 5.99 5.79</code></pre>
<p>The same information is provided, but there are two important differences in the format: 1) each row includes several observations and 2) one of the variables, year, is stored in the header. For the tidyverse packages to be optimally used, data need to be reshaped into <code>tidy</code> format, which you will learn to do throughout this course. For starters, though, we will use example datasets that are already in tidy format.</p>
<p>Although not immediately obvious, as you go through the book you will start to appreciate the advantages of working in a framework in which functions use tidy formats for both inputs and outputs. You will see how this permits the data analyst to focus on more important aspects of the analysis rather than the format of the data.</p>

<div id="manipulating-data-frames" class="section level2">
<h2>Manipulating data frames</h2>
<p>The <strong>dplyr</strong> package from the <strong>tidyverse</strong> introduces functions that perform some of the most common operations when working with data frames and uses names for these functions that are relatively easy to remember. For instance, to change the data table by adding a new column, we use <code>mutate</code>. To filter the data table to a subset of rows, we use <code>filter</code>. Finally, to subset the data by selecting specific columns, we use <code>select</code>.</p>
<div id="adding-a-column-with-mutate" class="section level3">
<h3>Adding a column with <code>mutate</code></h3>
<p>We want all the necessary information for our analysis to be included in the data table. So the first task is to add the murder rates to our murders data frame. The function <code>mutate</code> takes the data frame as a first argument and the name and values of the variable as a second argument using the convention <code>name = values</code>. So, to add murder rates, we use:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dslabs)
data(&quot;murders&quot;)
murders &lt;- mutate(murders, rate = total / population * 100000)</code></pre>
<p>Notice that here we used <code>total</code> and <code>population</code> inside the function, which are objects that are <strong>not</strong> defined in our workspace. But why don’t we get an error?</p>
<p>This is one of <strong>dplyr</strong>’s main features. Functions in this package, such as <code>mutate</code>, know to look for variables in the data frame provided in the first argument. In the call to mutate above, <code>total</code> will have the values in <code>murders$total</code>. This approach makes the code much more readable.</p>
<p>We can see that the new column is added:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(murders)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##        state abb region population total     rate
## 1    Alabama  AL  South    4779736   135 2.824424
## 2     Alaska  AK   West     710231    19 2.675186
## 3    Arizona  AZ   West    6392017   232 3.629527
## 4   Arkansas  AR  South    2915918    93 3.189390
## 5 California  CA   West   37253956  1257 3.374138
## 6   Colorado  CO   West    5029196    65 1.292453</code></pre>
<p>Although we have overwritten the original <code>murders</code> object, this does not change the object that loaded with <code>data(murders)</code>. If we load the <code>murders</code> data again, the original will overwrite our mutated version.</p>
</div>
<div id="subsetting-with-filter" class="section level3">
<h3>Subsetting with <code>filter</code></h3>
<p>Now suppose that we want to filter the data table to only show the entries for which the murder rate is lower than 0.71. To do this we use the <code>filter</code> function, which takes the data table as the first argument and then the conditional statement as the second. Like <code>mutate</code>, we can use the unquoted variable names from <code>murders</code> inside the function and it will know we mean the columns and not objects in the workspace.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>filter(murders, rate &lt;= 0.71)</code></pre>

<h3>Selecting columns with <code>select</code></h3>
<p>Although our data table only has six columns, some data tables include hundreds. If we want to view just a few, we can use the <strong>dplyr</strong> <code>select</code> function. In the code below we select three columns, assign this to a new object and then filter the new object:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>new_table &lt;- select(murders, state, region, rate)
filter(new_table, rate &lt;= 0.71)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##           state        region      rate
## 1        Hawaii          West 0.5145920
## 2          Iowa North Central 0.6893484
## 3 New Hampshire     Northeast 0.3798036
## 4  North Dakota North Central 0.5947151
## 5       Vermont     Northeast 0.3196211</code></pre>
<p>In the call to <code>select</code>, the first argument <code>murders</code> is an object, but <code>state</code>, <code>region</code>, and <code>rate</code> are variable names.</p>

</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)

<p>You can add columns using the <strong>dplyr</strong> function <code>mutate</code>. This function is aware of the column names and inside the function you can call them unquoted:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>murders &lt;- mutate(murders, population_in_millions = population / 10^6)</code></pre>
<p>We can write <code>population</code> rather than <code>murders$population</code>. The function <code>mutate</code> knows we are grabbing columns from <code>murders</code>.</p>
<p>Use the function <code>mutate</code> to add a murders column named <code>rate</code> with the per 100,000 murder rate as in the example code above. Make sure you redefine <code>murders</code> as done in the example code above ( murders &lt;- [your code]) so we can keep using this variable.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If <code>rank(x)</code> gives you the ranks of <code>x</code> from lowest to highest, <code>rank(-x)</code> gives you the ranks from highest to lowest.

Make sure you redefine <code>murders</code> so we can keep using this variable.</p></li>
<li><p>With <strong>dplyr</strong>, we can use <code>select</code> to show only certain columns. For example, with this code we would only show the states and population sizes:</p></li>

<pre class="r"><code>select(murders, state, population) %&gt;% head()</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>select</code> to show the state names and abbreviations in <code>murders</code>. Do not redefine <code>murders</code>, just show the results.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The <strong>dplyr</strong> function <code>filter</code> is used to choose specific rows of the data frame to keep. Unlike <code>select</code> which is for columns, <code>filter</code> is for rows. For example, you can show just the New York row like this:</li>

<pre class="r"><code>filter(murders, state == &quot;New York&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>You can use other logical vectors to filter rows.</p>
<p>Use <code>filter</code> to show the top 5 states with the highest murder rates. After we add murder rate and rank, do not change the murders dataset, just show the result. Remember that you can filter based on the <code>rank</code> column.</p>

<div id="the-pipe" class="section level2">
<h2>The pipe: <code>%&gt;%</code></h2>
<p>With <strong>dplyr</strong> we can perform a series of operations, for example <code>select</code> and then <code>filter</code>, by sending the results of one function to another using what is called the <em>pipe operator</em>: <code>%&gt;%</code>. Some details are included below.</p>
<p>We wrote code above to show three variables (state, region, rate) for states that have murder rates below 0.71. To do this, we defined the intermediate object <code>new_table</code>. In <strong>dplyr</strong> we can write code that looks more like a description of what we want to do without intermediate objects:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \mbox{original data }
\rightarrow \mbox{ select }
\rightarrow \mbox{ filter } \]</span></p>
<p>For such an operation, we can use the pipe <code>%&gt;%</code>. The code looks like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>murders %&gt;% select(state, region, rate) %&gt;% filter(rate &lt;= 0.71)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##           state        region      rate
## 1        Hawaii          West 0.5145920
## 2          Iowa North Central 0.6893484
## 3 New Hampshire     Northeast 0.3798036
## 4  North Dakota North Central 0.5947151
## 5       Vermont     Northeast 0.3196211</code></pre>
<p>This line of code is equivalent to the two lines of code above. What is going on here?</p>
<p>In general, the pipe <em>sends</em> the result of the left side of the pipe to be the first argument of the function on the right side of the pipe. Here is a very simple example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>16 %&gt;% sqrt()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 4</code></pre>
<p>We can continue to pipe values along:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>16 %&gt;% sqrt() %&gt;% log2()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 2</code></pre>
<p>The above statement is equivalent to <code>log2(sqrt(16))</code>.</p>
<p>Remember that the pipe sends values to the first argument, so we can define other arguments as if the first argument is already defined:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>16 %&gt;% sqrt() %&gt;% log(base = 2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 2</code></pre>
<p>Therefore, when using the pipe with data frames and <strong>dplyr</strong>, we no longer need to specify the required first argument since the <strong>dplyr</strong> functions we have described all take the data as the first argument. In the code we wrote:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>murders %&gt;% select(state, region, rate) %&gt;% filter(rate &lt;= 0.71)</code></pre>
<p><code>murders</code> is the first argument of the <code>select</code> function, and the new data frame (formerly <code>new_table</code>) is the first argument of the <code>filter</code> function.</p>
<p>Note that the pipe works well with functions where the first argument is the input data. Functions in <strong>tidyverse</strong> packages like <strong>dplyr</strong> have this format and can be used easily with the pipe. It’s worth noting that as of R 4.1, there is a base-R version of the pipe <code>|&gt;</code>, though this has its disadvantages. We’ll stick with <code>%&gt;%</code> for now.</p>
<div class="fyi">
<p><strong>TRY IT</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The pipe <code>%&gt;%</code> can be used to perform operations sequentially without having to define intermediate objects. Start by redefining murder to include rate and rank.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>murders &lt;- mutate(murders, rate =  total / population * 100000,
                  rank = rank(-rate))</code></pre>
<p>In the solution to the previous exercise, we did the following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_states &lt;- filter(murders, region %in% c(&quot;Northeast&quot;, &quot;West&quot;) &amp;
                      rate &lt; 1)

select(my_states, state, rate, rank)</code></pre>
<p>The pipe <code>%&gt;%</code> permits us to perform both operations sequentially without having to define an intermediate variable <code>my_states</code>. We therefore could have mutated and selected in the same line like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mutate(murders, rate =  total / population * 100000,
       rank = rank(-rate)) %&gt;%
  select(state, rate, rank)</code></pre>
<p>Notice that <code>select</code> no longer has a data frame as the first argument. The first argument is assumed to be the result of the operation conducted right before the <code>%&gt;%</code>.</p>
<p>Repeat the previous exercise, but now instead of creating a new object, show the result and only include the state, rate, and rank columns. Use a pipe <code>%&gt;%</code> to do this in just one line.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Reset <code>murders</code> to the original table by using <code>data(murders)</code>. Use a pipe to create a new data frame called <code>my_states</code> that considers only states in the Northeast or West which have a murder rate lower than 1, and contains only the state, rate and rank columns. The pipe should also have four components separated by three <code>%&gt;%</code>. The code should look something like this:</li>

<div id="summarizing-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Summarizing data</h2>
<p>An important part of exploratory data analysis is summarizing data. The average and standard deviation are two examples of widely used summary statistics. More informative summaries can often be achieved by first splitting data into groups. In this section, we cover two new <strong>dplyr</strong> verbs that make these computations easier: <code>summarize</code> and <code>group_by</code>. We learn to access resulting values using the <code>pull</code> function.</p>
<div id="summarize" class="section level3">
<h3><code>summarize</code></h3>
<p>The <code>summarize</code> function in <strong>dplyr</strong> provides a way to compute summary statistics with intuitive and readable code. We start with a simple example based on heights. The <code>heights</code> dataset includes heights and sex reported by students in an in-class survey.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
library(dslabs)
data(heights)</code></pre>
<p>The following code computes the average and standard deviation for females:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>s &lt;- heights %&gt;%
  filter(sex == &quot;Female&quot;) %&gt;%
  summarize(average = mean(height), standard_deviation = sd(height))
s</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    average standard_deviation
## 1 64.93942           3.760656</code></pre>
<p>This takes our original data table as input, filters it to keep only females, and then produces a new summarized table with just the average and the standard deviation of heights. We get to choose the names of the columns of the resulting table. For example, above we decided to use <code>average</code> and <code>standard_deviation</code>, but we could have used other names just the same.</p>
<p>Because the resulting table stored in <code>s</code> is a data frame, we can access the components with the accessor <code>$</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>s$average</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 64.93942</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>s$standard_deviation</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3.760656</code></pre>
<p>As with most other <strong>dplyr</strong> functions, <code>summarize</code> is aware of the variable names and we can use them directly. So when inside the call to the <code>summarize</code> function we write <code>mean(height)</code>, the function is accessing the column with the name “height” and then computing the average of the resulting numeric vector. We can compute any other summary that operates on vectors and returns a single value. For example, we can add the median, minimum, and maximum heights like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>heights %&gt;%
  filter(sex == &quot;Female&quot;) %&gt;%
  summarize(median = median(height), minimum = min(height),
            maximum = max(height))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##     median minimum maximum
## 1 64.98031      51      79</code></pre>
<p>We can obtain these three values with just one line using the <code>quantile</code> function: for example, <code>quantile(x, c(0,0.5,1))</code> returns the min (0th percentile), median (50th percentile), and max (100th percentile) of the vector <code>x</code>. However, if we attempt to use a function like this that returns two or more values inside <code>summarize</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>heights %&gt;%
  filter(sex == &quot;Female&quot;) %&gt;%
  summarize(range = quantile(height, c(0, 0.5, 1)))</code></pre>
<p>we will receive an error: <code>Error: expecting result of length one, got : 2</code>. With the function <code>summarize</code>, we can only call functions that return a single value. In Section <a href="#do"><strong>??</strong></a>, we will learn how to deal with functions that return more than one value.</p>
<p>For another example of how we can use the <code>summarize</code> function, let’s compute the average murder rate for the United States. Remember our data table includes total murders and population size for each state and we have already used <strong>dplyr</strong> to add a murder rate column:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>murders &lt;- murders %&gt;% mutate(rate = total/population*100000)</code></pre>
<p>Remember that the US murder rate is <strong>not</strong> the average of the state murder rates:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summarize(murders, mean(rate))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   mean(rate)
## 1   2.779125</code></pre>
<p>This is because in the computation above the small states are given the same weight as the large ones. The US murder rate is the total number of murders in the US divided by the total US population. So the correct computation is:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>us_murder_rate &lt;- murders %&gt;%
  summarize(rate = sum(total) / sum(population) * 100000)
us_murder_rate</code></pre>
<pre><code>##       rate
## 1 3.034555</code></pre>
<p>This computation counts larger states proportionally to their size which results in a larger value.</p>
</div>
<div id="pull" class="section level3">
<h3><code>pull</code></h3>
<p>The <code>us_murder_rate</code> object defined above represents just one number. Yet we are storing it in a data frame:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>class(us_murder_rate)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot;</code></pre>
<p>since, as most <strong>dplyr</strong> functions, <code>summarize</code> always returns a data frame.</p>
<p>This might be problematic if we want to use this result with functions that require a numeric value. Here we show a useful trick for accessing values stored in data when using pipes: when a data object is piped that object and its columns can be accessed using the <code>pull</code> function. To understand what we mean take a look at this line of code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>us_murder_rate %&gt;% pull(rate)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3.034555</code></pre>
<p>This returns the value in the <code>rate</code> column of <code>us_murder_rate</code> making it equivalent to <code>us_murder_rate$rate</code>.</p>
<p>To get a number from the original data table with one line of code we can type:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>us_murder_rate &lt;- murders %&gt;%
  summarize(rate = sum(total) / sum(population) * 100000) %&gt;%
  pull(rate)

us_murder_rate</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3.034555</code></pre>
<p>which is now a numeric:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>class(us_murder_rate)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;numeric&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="group-by" class="section level3">
<h3>Group then summarize with <code>group_by</code></h3>
<p>A common operation in data exploration is to first split data into groups and then compute summaries for each group. For example, we may want to compute the average and standard deviation for men’s and women’s heights separately. The <code>group_by</code> function helps us do this.</p>
<p>If we type this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>heights %&gt;% group_by(sex)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1,050 x 2
## # Groups:   sex [2]
##    sex    height
##    &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
##  1 Male       75
##  2 Male       70
##  3 Male       68
##  4 Male       74
##  5 Male       61
##  6 Female     65
##  7 Female     66
##  8 Female     62
##  9 Female     66
## 10 Male       67
## # ... with 1,040 more rows</code></pre>
<p>The result does not look very different from <code>heights</code>, except we see <code>Groups: sex [2]</code> when we print the object. Although not immediately obvious from its appearance, this is now a special data frame called a <em>grouped data frame</em>, and <strong>dplyr</strong> functions, in particular <code>summarize</code>, will behave differently when acting on this object. Conceptually, you can think of this table as many tables, with the same columns but not necessarily the same number of rows, stacked together in one object. When we summarize the data after grouping, this is what happens:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>heights %&gt;%
  group_by(sex) %&gt;%
  summarize(average = mean(height), standard_deviation = sd(height))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 x 3
##   sex    average standard_deviation
##   &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 Female    64.9               3.76
## 2 Male      69.3               3.61</code></pre>
<p>The <code>summarize</code> function applies the summarization to each group separately.</p>
<p>For another example, let’s compute the median murder rate in the four regions of the country:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>murders %&gt;%
  group_by(region) %&gt;%
  summarize(median_rate = median(rate))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 4 x 2
##   region        median_rate
##   &lt;fct&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 Northeast            1.80
## 2 South                3.40
## 3 North Central        1.97
## 4 West                 1.29</code></pre>

<div id="sorting-data-frames" class="section level2">
<h2>Sorting data frames</h2>
<p>When examining a dataset, it is often convenient to sort the table by the different columns. We know about the <code>order</code> and <code>sort</code> function, but for ordering entire tables, the <strong>dplyr</strong> function <code>arrange</code> is useful. For example, here we order the states by population size:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>murders %&gt;%
  arrange(population) %&gt;%
  head()</code></pre>
<pre><code>##                  state abb        region population total       rate
## 1              Wyoming  WY          West     563626     5  0.8871131
## 2 District of Columbia  DC         South     601723    99 16.4527532
## 3              Vermont  VT     Northeast     625741     2  0.3196211
## 4         North Dakota  ND North Central     672591     4  0.5947151
## 5               Alaska  AK          West     710231    19  2.6751860
## 6         South Dakota  SD North Central     814180     8  0.9825837</code></pre>
<p>With <code>arrange</code> we get to decide which column to sort by. To see the states by murder rate, from lowest to highest, we arrange by <code>rate</code> instead:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>murders %&gt;%
  arrange(rate) %&gt;%
  head()</code></pre>
<pre><code>##           state abb        region population total      rate
## 1       Vermont  VT     Northeast     625741     2 0.3196211
## 2 New Hampshire  NH     Northeast    1316470     5 0.3798036
## 3        Hawaii  HI          West    1360301     7 0.5145920
## 4  North Dakota  ND North Central     672591     4 0.5947151

## 6         Idaho  ID          West    1567582    12 0.7655102</code></pre>
<p>Note that the default behavior is to order in ascending order. In <strong>dplyr</strong>, the function <code>desc</code> transforms a vector so that it is in descending order. To sort the table in descending order, we can type:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>murders %&gt;%
  arrange(desc(rate))</code></pre>
<div id="nested-sorting" class="section level3">
<h3>Nested sorting</h3>
<p>If we are ordering by a column with ties, we can use a second column to break the tie. Similarly, a third column can be used to break ties between first and second and so on. Here we order by <code>region</code>, then within region we order by murder rate:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>murders %&gt;%
  arrange(region, rate) %&gt;%
  head()</code></pre>
<pre><code>##           state abb    region population total      rate

<h3>The top <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span></h3>
<p>In the code above, we have used the function <code>head</code> to avoid having the page fill up with the entire dataset. If we want to see a larger proportion, we can use the <code>top_n</code> function. This function takes a data frame as it’s first argument, the number of rows to show in the second, and the variable to filter by in the third. Here is an example of how to see the top 5 rows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>murders %&gt;% top_n(5, rate)</code></pre>

This center has conducted a series of health and nutrition surveys since the 1960’s. Starting in 1999, about 5,000 individuals of all ages have been interviewed every year and they complete the health examination component of the survey. Part of the data is made available via the <strong>NHANES</strong> package. Once you install the <strong>NHANES</strong> package, you can load the data like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(NHANES)
data(NHANES)</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>NHANES</strong> data has many missing values. The <code>mean</code> and <code>sd</code> functions in R will return <code>NA</code> if any of the entries of the input vector is an <code>NA</code>. Here is an example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dslabs)
data(na_example)
mean(na_example)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] NA</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>sd(na_example)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] NA</code></pre>
<p>To ignore the <code>NA</code>s we can use the <code>na.rm</code> argument:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mean(na_example, na.rm = TRUE)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 2.301754</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>sd(na_example, na.rm = TRUE)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1.22338</code></pre>
<p>Let’s now explore the NHANES data.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We will provide some basic facts about blood pressure. First let’s select a group to set the standard. We will use 20-to-29-year-old females. <code>AgeDecade</code> is a categorical variable with these ages. Note that the category is coded like " 20-29", with a space in front! What is the average and standard deviation of systolic blood pressure as saved in the <code>BPSysAve</code> variable? Save it to a variable called <code>ref</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hint: Use <code>filter</code> and <code>summarize</code> and use the <code>na.rm = TRUE</code> argument when computing the average and standard deviation. You can also filter the NA values using <code>filter</code>.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Using a pipe, assign the average to a numeric variable <code>ref_avg</code>. Hint: Use the code similar to above and then <code>pull</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Now report the min and max values for the same group.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the average and standard deviation for females, but for each age group separately rather than a selected decade as in question 1. Note that the age groups are defined by <code>AgeDecade</code>. Hint: rather than filtering by age and gender, filter by <code>Gender</code> and then use <code>group_by</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat exercise 4 for males.</p></li>
<li><p>We can actually combine both summaries for exercises 4 and 5 into one line of code. This is because <code>group_by</code> permits us to group by more than one variable. Obtain one big summary table using <code>group_by(AgeDecade, Gender)</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>For males between the ages of 40-49, compare systolic blood pressure across race as reported in the <code>Race1</code> variable. Order the resulting table from lowest to highest average systolic blood pressure.</p></li>

<h2>Tibbles</h2>
<p>Tidy data must be stored in data frames. We introduced the data frame in Section <a href="#data-frames"><strong>??</strong></a> and have been using the <code>murders</code> data frame throughout the book. In Section <a href="#group-by"><strong>??</strong></a> we introduced the <code>group_by</code> function, which permits stratifying data before computing summary statistics. But where is the group information stored in the data frame?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>murders %&gt;% group_by(region)</code></pre>

## # ... with 41 more rows</code></pre>
<p>Notice that there are no columns with this information. But, if you look closely at the output above, you see the line <code>A tibble</code> followd by dimensions. We can learn the class of the returned object using:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>murders %&gt;% group_by(region) %&gt;% class()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;grouped_df&quot; &quot;tbl_df&quot;     &quot;tbl&quot;        &quot;data.frame&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The <code>tbl</code>, pronounced tibble, is a special kind of data frame. The functions <code>group_by</code> and <code>summarize</code> always return this type of data frame. The <code>group_by</code> function returns a special kind of <code>tbl</code>, the <code>grouped_df</code>. We will say more about these later. For consistency, the <strong>dplyr</strong> manipulation verbs (<code>select</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>mutate</code>, and <code>arrange</code>) preserve the class of the input: if they receive a regular data frame they return a regular data frame, while if they receive a tibble they return a tibble. But tibbles are the preferred format in the tidyverse and as a result tidyverse functions that produce a data frame from scratch return a tibble. For example, in Chapter <a href="#importing-data"><strong>??</strong></a> we will see that tidyverse functions used to import data create tibbles.</p>
<p>Tibbles are very similar to data frames. In fact, you can think of them as a modern version of data frames. Nonetheless there are three important differences which we describe next.</p>
<div id="tibbles-display-better" class="section level3">
<h3>Tibbles display better</h3>
<p>The print method for tibbles is more readable than that of a data frame. To see this, compare the outputs of typing <code>murders</code> and the output of murders if we convert it to a tibble. We can do this using <code>as_tibble(murders)</code>. If using RStudio, output for a tibble adjusts to your window size. To see this, change the width of your R console and notice how more/less columns are shown.</p>
</div>
<div id="subsets-of-tibbles-are-tibbles" class="section level3">
<h3>Subsets of tibbles are tibbles</h3>
<p>If you subset the columns of a data frame, you may get back an object that is not a data frame, such as a vector or scalar. For example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>class(murders[,4])</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;numeric&quot;</code></pre>
<p>is not a data frame. With tibbles this does not happen:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>class(as_tibble(murders)[,4])</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;tbl_df&quot;     &quot;tbl&quot;        &quot;data.frame&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This is useful in the tidyverse since functions require data frames as input.</p>
<p>With tibbles, if you want to access the vector that defines a column, and not get back a data frame, you need to use the accessor <code>$</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>class(as_tibble(murders)$population)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;numeric&quot;</code></pre>
<p>A related feature is that tibbles will give you a warning if you try to access a column that does not exist. If we accidentally write <code>Population</code> instead of <code>population</code> this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>murders$Population</code></pre>
<pre><code>## NULL</code></pre>
<p>returns a <code>NULL</code> with no warning, which can make it harder to debug. In contrast, if we try this with a tibble we get an informative warning:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>as_tibble(murders)$Population</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: Unknown or uninitialised column: `Population`.</code></pre>
<pre><code>## NULL</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="tibbles-can-have-complex-entries" class="section level3">
<h3>Tibbles can have complex entries</h3>
<p>While data frame columns need to be vectors of numbers, strings, or logical values, tibbles can have more complex objects, such as lists or functions. Also, we can create tibbles with functions:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tibble(id = c(1, 2, 3), func = c(mean, median, sd))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##      id func  
##   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;list&gt;
## 1     1 &lt;fn&gt;  
## 2     2 &lt;fn&gt;  
## 3     3 &lt;fn&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="tibbles-can-be-grouped" class="section level3">
<h3>Tibbles can be grouped</h3>
<p>The function <code>group_by</code> returns a special kind of tibble: a grouped tibble. This class stores information that lets you know which rows are in which groups. The tidyverse functions, in particular the <code>summarize</code> function, are aware of the group information.</p>
</div>
<div id="create-a-tibble-using-tibble-instead-of-data.frame" class="section level3">
<h3>Create a tibble using <code>tibble</code> instead of <code>data.frame</code></h3>
<p>It is sometimes useful for us to create our own data frames. To create a data frame in the tibble format, you can do this by using the <code>tibble</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>grades &lt;- tibble(names = c(&quot;John&quot;, &quot;Juan&quot;, &quot;Jean&quot;, &quot;Yao&quot;),
                     exam_1 = c(95, 80, 90, 85),
                     exam_2 = c(90, 85, 85, 90))</code></pre>
<p>Note that base R (without packages loaded) has a function with a very similar name, <code>data.frame</code>, that can be used to create a regular data frame rather than a tibble. One other important difference is that by default <code>data.frame</code> coerces characters into factors without providing a warning or message:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>grades &lt;- data.frame(names = c(&quot;John&quot;, &quot;Juan&quot;, &quot;Jean&quot;, &quot;Yao&quot;),
                     exam_1 = c(95, 80, 90, 85),
                     exam_2 = c(90, 85, 85, 90))
class(grades$names)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;character&quot;</code></pre>
<p>To avoid this, we use the rather cumbersome argument <code>stringsAsFactors</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>grades &lt;- data.frame(names = c(&quot;John&quot;, &quot;Juan&quot;, &quot;Jean&quot;, &quot;Yao&quot;),
                     exam_1 = c(95, 80, 90, 85),
                     exam_2 = c(90, 85, 85, 90),
                     stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
class(grades$names)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;character&quot;</code></pre>
<p>To convert a regular data frame to a tibble, you can use the <code>as_tibble</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>as_tibble(grades) %&gt;% class()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;tbl_df&quot;     &quot;tbl&quot;        &quot;data.frame&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="the-dot-operator" class="section level2">
<h2>The dot operator</h2>
<p>One of the advantages of using the pipe <code>%&gt;%</code> is that we do not have to keep naming new objects as we manipulate the data frame. As a quick reminder, if we want to compute the median murder rate for states in the southern states, instead of typing:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tab_1 &lt;- filter(murders, region == &quot;South&quot;)
tab_2 &lt;- mutate(tab_1, rate = total / population * 10^5)
rates &lt;- tab_2$rate
median(rates)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3.398069</code></pre>
<p>We can avoid defining any new intermediate objects by instead typing:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>filter(murders, region == &quot;South&quot;) %&gt;%
  mutate(rate = total / population * 10^5) %&gt;%
  summarize(median = median(rate)) %&gt;%
  pull(median)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3.398069</code></pre>
<p>We can do this because each of these functions takes a data frame as the first argument. But what if we want to access a component of the data frame. For example, what if the <code>pull</code> function was not available and we wanted to access <code>tab_2$rate</code>? What data frame name would we use? The answer is the dot operator.</p>
<p>For example to access the rate vector without the <code>pull</code> function we could use</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rates &lt;-   filter(murders, region == &quot;South&quot;) %&gt;%
  mutate(rate = total / population * 10^5) %&gt;%
  .$rate
median(rates)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3.398069</code></pre>
<p>In the next section, we will see other instances in which using the <code>.</code> is useful.</p>
</div>
<div id="do" class="section level2">
<h2><code>do</code></h2>
<p>The tidyverse functions know how to interpret grouped tibbles. Furthermore, to facilitate stringing commands through the pipe <code>%&gt;%</code>, tidyverse functions consistently return data frames, since this assures that the output of a function is accepted as the input of another. But most R functions do not recognize grouped tibbles nor do they return data frames. The <code>quantile</code> function is an example we described in Section <a href="#summarize"><strong>??</strong></a>. The <code>do</code> function serves as a bridge between R functions such as <code>quantile</code> and the tidyverse. The <code>do</code> function understands grouped tibbles and always returns a data frame.</p>
<p>In Section <a href="#summarize"><strong>??</strong></a>, we noted that if we attempt to use <code>quantile</code> to obtain the min, median and max in one call, we will receive an error: <code>Error: expecting result of length one, got : 2</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data(heights)
heights %&gt;%
  filter(sex == &quot;Female&quot;) %&gt;%
  summarize(range = quantile(height, c(0, 0.5, 1)))</code></pre>
<p>We can use the <code>do</code> function to fix this.</p>
<p>First we have to write a function that fits into the tidyverse approach: that is, it receives a data frame and returns a data frame.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_summary &lt;- function(dat){
  x &lt;- quantile(dat$height, c(0, 0.5, 1))
  tibble(min = x[1], median = x[2], max = x[3])
}</code></pre>
<p>We can now apply the function to the heights dataset to obtain the summaries:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>heights %&gt;%
  group_by(sex) %&gt;%
  my_summary</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 x 3
##     min median   max
##   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1    50   68.5  82.7</code></pre>
<p>But this is not what we want. We want a summary for each sex and the code returned just one summary. This is because <code>my_summary</code> is not part of the tidyverse and does not know how to handled grouped tibbles. <code>do</code> makes this connection:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>heights %&gt;%
  group_by(sex) %&gt;%
  do(my_summary(.))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 x 4
## # Groups:   sex [2]
##   sex      min median   max
##   &lt;fct&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 Female    51   65.0  79  
## 2 Male      50   69    82.7</code></pre>
<p>Note that here we need to use the dot operator. The tibble created by <code>group_by</code> is piped to <code>do</code>. Within the call to <code>do</code>, the name of this tibble is <code>.</code> and we want to send it to <code>my_summary</code>. If you do not use the dot, then <code>my_summary</code> has <em>no argument</em> and returns an error telling us that <code>argument "dat"</code> is missing. You can see the error by typing:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>heights %&gt;%
  group_by(sex) %&gt;%
  do(my_summary())</code></pre>
<p>If you do not use the parenthesis, then the function is not executed and instead <code>do</code> tries to return the function. This gives an error because <code>do</code> must always return a data frame. You can see the error by typing:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>heights %&gt;%
  group_by(sex) %&gt;%
  do(my_summary)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="the-purrr-package" class="section level2">
<h2>The <strong>purrr</strong> package</h2>
<p>In Section <a href="#vectorization"><strong>??</strong></a> we learned about the <code>sapply</code> function, which permitted us to apply the same function to each element of a vector. We constructed a function and used <code>sapply</code> to compute the sum of the first <code>n</code> integers for several values of <code>n</code> like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>compute_s_n &lt;- function(n){
  x &lt;- 1:n
  sum(x)
}
n &lt;- 1:25
s_n &lt;- sapply(n, compute_s_n)
s_n</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]   1   3   6  10  15  21  28  36  45  55  66  78  91 105 120 136 153 171 190
## [20] 210 231 253 276 300 325</code></pre>
<p>This type of operation, applying the same function or procedure to elements of an object, is quite common in data analysis. The <strong>purrr</strong> package includes functions similar to <code>sapply</code> but that better interact with other tidyverse functions. The main advantage is that we can better control the output type of functions. In contrast, <code>sapply</code> can return several different object types; for example, we might expect a numeric result from a line of code, but <code>sapply</code> might convert our result to character under some circumstances. <strong>purrr</strong> functions will never do this: they will return objects of a specified type or return an error if this is not possible.</p>
<p>The first <strong>purrr</strong> function we will learn is <code>map</code>, which works very similar to <code>sapply</code> but always, without exception, returns a list:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(purrr) # or library(tidyverse)
n &lt;- 1:25
s_n &lt;- map(n, compute_s_n)
class(s_n)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;list&quot;</code></pre>
<p>If we want a numeric vector, we can instead use <code>map_dbl</code> which always returns a vector of numeric values.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>s_n &lt;- map_dbl(n, compute_s_n)
class(s_n)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;numeric&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This produces the same results as the <code>sapply</code> call shown above.</p>
<p>A particularly useful <strong>purrr</strong> function for interacting with the rest of the tidyverse is <code>map_df</code>, which always returns a tibble data frame. However, the function being called needs to return a vector or a list with names. For this reason, the following code would result in a <code>Argument 1 must have names</code> error:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>s_n &lt;- map_df(n, compute_s_n)</code></pre>
<p>We need to change the function to make this work:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>compute_s_n &lt;- function(n){
  x &lt;- 1:n
  tibble(sum = sum(x))
}
s_n &lt;- map_df(n, compute_s_n)
head(s_n)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 1
##     sum
##   &lt;int&gt;
## 1     1
## 2     3
## 3     6
## 4    10

<p>The <strong>purrr</strong> package provides much more functionality not covered here. For more details you can consult <a href="https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/">this online resource</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="tidyverse-conditionals" class="section level2">
<h2>Tidyverse conditionals</h2>
<p>A typical data analysis will often involve one or more conditional operations. In Section <a href="#conditionals"><strong>??</strong></a> we described the <code>ifelse</code> function, which we will use extensively in this book. In this section we present two <strong>dplyr</strong> functions that provide further functionality for performing conditional operations.</p>
<div id="case_when" class="section level3">
<h3><code>case_when</code></h3>
<p>The <code>case_when</code> function is useful for vectorizing conditional statements. It is similar to <code>ifelse</code> but can output any number of values, as opposed to just <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>. Here is an example splitting numbers into negative, positive, and 0:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- c(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2)
case_when(x &lt; 0 ~ &quot;Negative&quot;,
          x &gt; 0 ~ &quot;Positive&quot;,
          x == 0  ~ &quot;Zero&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Negative&quot; &quot;Negative&quot; &quot;Zero&quot;     &quot;Positive&quot; &quot;Positive&quot;</code></pre>
<p>A common use for this function is to define categorical variables based on existing variables. For example, suppose we want to compare the murder rates in four groups of states: <em>New England</em>, <em>West Coast</em>, <em>South</em>, and <em>other</em>. For each state, we need to ask if it is in New England, if it is not we ask if it is in the West Coast, if not we ask if it is in the South, and if not we assign <em>other</em>. Here is how we use <code>case_when</code> to do this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>murders %&gt;%
  mutate(group = case_when(
    abb %in% c(&quot;ME&quot;, &quot;NH&quot;, &quot;VT&quot;, &quot;MA&quot;, &quot;RI&quot;, &quot;CT&quot;) ~ &quot;New England&quot;,
    abb %in% c(&quot;WA&quot;, &quot;OR&quot;, &quot;CA&quot;) ~ &quot;West Coast&quot;,
    region == &quot;South&quot; ~ &quot;South&quot;,
    TRUE ~ &quot;Other&quot;)) %&gt;%
  group_by(group) %&gt;%
  summarize(rate = sum(total) / sum(population) * 10^5)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 4 x 2
##   group        rate
##   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 New England  1.72
## 2 Other        2.71
## 3 South        3.63
## 4 West Coast   2.90</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="between" class="section level3">
<h3><code>between</code></h3>
<p>A common operation in data analysis is to determine if a value falls inside an interval. We can check this using conditionals. For example, to check if the elements of a vector <code>x</code> are between <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> we can type</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &gt;= a &amp; x &lt;= b</code></pre>
<p>However, this can become cumbersome, especially within the tidyverse approach. The <code>between</code> function performs the same operation.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>between(x, a, b)</code></pre>
<div class="fyi">
