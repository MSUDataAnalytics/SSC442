<p>Each week has a set of required readings that you should complete <strong><em>before</em></strong> coming to the (online) Tuesday lecture. That is, you should complete the reading, attend Tuesday class, then do the associated “exercises” (contained within the reading) before Thursday. You will be working each week’s lab between Tuesday afternoon and whenever the labs are due. Don’t forget your weekly writing, due Sunday at 11:59pm.</p>
<p>The course content is structured as follows. For each topic, we begin with a set of questions that might guide your reading and help frame your thoughts. These questions can serve as helpful starting places for your thinking; they are not representative of the totality of the content and are not intended to be limiting. You should not try to respond to all of these (or any of them if you don’t want to)—they’ll just help you know what to look for and think about as you read.</p>
<p>In the (hopefully unlikely) scenario that we go back to Zoom, all lecture videos will be posted to <a href="">our SSC442 channel on YouTube <i class="fas fa-film"></i></a>.</p>
