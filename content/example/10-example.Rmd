## Our data and goal
We want to use the `wooldridge::wage2` data on wages to generate and tune a non-parametric model of wages using a regression tree.

```{r, echo=T, include=F}
library(wooldridge)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(skimr)

wage2 = wooldridge::wage2

```

We've learned that our RMSE calculations have a hard time with `NA`s in the data. So let's use the `skim` output to drop variables with `NA` (see `n_missing`). Of course, there are other things we can do (impute the `NA`s, or make dummies for them), but for now, it's easiest to drop.

```{r, echo=T, include=T}
wage_clean = wage2 %>%
  dplyr::select(-brthord, -meduc, -feduc)
```

Once cleaned, we should be able to use `rpart(wage ~ ., data = wage_clean)` and not have any `NA`s in our prediction.

### Some functions
These functions are taken from our previous Content and Examples:

```{r}
rmse = function(actual, predicted) {
  sqrt(mean((actual - predicted) ^ 2))
}
```

```{r}
get_rmse = function(model, data, response) {
  rmse(actual = subset(data, select = response, drop = TRUE),
       predicted = predict(model, data))
}
```



## In-Class Tasks #1
Today in class, you'll work in groups of 3-4 on live-coding. Your output will be the weekly writing. One person in the group will need to have Rstudio up, be able to share screen, and have the correct packages loaded (`caret`, `rpart`, and `rpart.plot`, plus `skimr`). Copy the `rmse` and `get_rmse` code into a blank R script (you don't have to use RMarkdown, just use a blank R script and run from there).

For the first task, all I want you to do is the following:

- Estimate a default regression tree on `wage_clean` using the default parameters.
- Use `rpart.plot` to vizualize your regression tree, and *talk through the interpretation* with each other.
- Calculate the RMSE for your regression tree.

I'll cue you back in about 5 minutes. Remember, you can use `?wage2` to see the variable names. Make sure you know what variables are showing up in the plot and explaining `wage` in your model. You may find something odd at first and may need to drop more variables...

```{r, echo=F, include=F, eval=T}
wage_clean$lwage = NULL
```
**5 minutes**

### In-Class Task #1 Discussion
Let's choose a group to share their plot and discuss the results.


## Automating models
Let's talk about a little code shortcut that helps iterate through your model selection.

First, before, we used `list()` to store all of our models. This is because `list()` can "hold" anything at all, unlike a `matrix`, which is only numeric, or a `data.frame` which needs all rows in a column to be the same data type. `list()` is also recursive, so each element in a list can be a list. Of lists. Of lists!

Lists are also really easy to add to iteratively. We can initiate an empty list using `myList <- list()`, then we can add things to it. Note that we use the double `[` to index:

```{r, echo = T}
myList <- list()
myList[['first']] = 'This is the first thing on my list'
print(myList)
```

Lists let you name the "containers" (much like you can name colums in a `data.frame`). Our first one is called "first". We can add more later:

```{r, echo = T}
myList[['second']] = c(1,2,3)
print(myList)
```

And still more:

```{r, echo = T}
myList[['third']] = data.frame(a = c(1,2,3), b = c('Albert','Alex','Alice'))
print(myList)
```

Now we have a `data.frame` in there! We can use `lapply` to do something to every element in the list:

```{r, echo=T}
lapply(myList, length) # the length() function with the first entry being the list element
```

We get back a list of equal length but each (still-named) container is now the length of the original list's contents.

### Loops
`R` has a very useful looping function that takes the form:

```{r}
for(i in c('first','second','third')){
print(i)
}
```

Here, `R` is repeating the thing in the loop (`print(i)`) with a different value for `i` each time. `R` repeats only what is *inside the curly-brackets*, then when it reaches the close-curly-bracket, it goes back to the top, changes `i` to the next element, and repeats.

We can use this to train our models. First, we clear our list object `myList` by setting it equal to an empty list. Then, we loop over some regression tree tuning parameters. First, we have to figure out how to use the loop to set a *unique* name for each list container. To do this, we'll use `paste0('Tuning',i)` which will result in a character string of `Tuning0` when `i=0`, `Tuning0.01` when `i=0.01`, etc.

```{r}
myList <- list()   # resets the list. Otherwise, you'll just be adding to your old list!

for(i in c(0, 0.01, 0.02)){
  myList[[paste0('Tuning',i)]] = rpart(wage ~ ., data = wage_clean, cp = i)
}
```

If you use `names(myList)` you'll see the result of our `paste0` naming. If you want to see the plotted results, you can use:

```{r}
rpart.plot(myList[['Tuning0.01']])
```


## In-Class Task #2
Let's send you back to your groups. Using the loop method, generate 5 regression trees to explain `wage` in `wage_clean`. You can iterate through values of `cp`, the complexity parameter, or `minsplit`, the minimum # of points that have to be in each split.

**10 minutes**

### In-Class Task #2 Discussion

## Getting RMSE from the list
Finally, we want to move towards getting the RMSE for each of these trees. We've done this before using `lapply`. Let's introduce a neat coding shortcut, the `anonymous function`:

```{r}
myRMSE <- lapply(myList, function(x){
                  get_rmse(x, wage_clean, 'wage')
                  } )

print(myRMSE)
```

Well, it gets us the right answer, but whaaaaaat is going on? Curly brackets? `x`?

This is an "anonymous function", or a function created on the fly. Here's how it works in `lapply`:

- The first argument is the list you want to do something to
- The second argument would usually be the function you want to apply, like `get_rmse`
- Here, we're going to ask R to *temporarily* create a function that takes one argument, `x`.
- `x` is going to be each list element in `myList`.
- Think of it as a loop:
  - Take the first element of `myList` and refer to it as `x`. Run the function.
  - Then it'll take the second element of `myList` and refer to it as `x` and run the function.
  - Repeat until all elements of `x` have been used.
- Once the anonymous function has been applied to `x`, the result is passed back and saved as the new element of the list output, always in the same position from where the `x` was taken.

So you can think of it like this:

````
x = myList[[1]]
myList[[1]] = get_rmse(x, wage_clean, 'wage')

x = myList[[2]]
myList[[2]] = get_rmse(x, wage_clean, 'wage')

x = myList[[3]]
myList[[3]] = get_rmse(x, wage_clean, 'wage')
````

You can refer to `myList` by name:
- `myList[['Tuning0.01']]`

Or you can refer to `myList` by the index:
- `myList[[2]]`

Just like you can refer to `data.frame` columns by name or by index.

## In-Class Task #3
Let's send you to work one more time, and use `lapply` to get a list of your RMSE's (one for each of your models). Note that we are not yet splitting into `test` and `train` (which you **will** need to do on your lab assignment).

Once you have your list, **create the plot of RMSEs** similar to the one we looked at in Content this week. Note: you can use `unlist(myRMSE)` to get a numeric vector of the RMSE's (as long as all of the elements in `myRMSE` are numeric). Then, it's a matter of plotting either with base `plot` or with `ggplot` (if you use `ggplot` you'll have to `tidy` the RMSE by adding the index column or naming the x-axis).

**Remaining time**
