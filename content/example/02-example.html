<h1>Introduction to data visualization</h1>
<p>Looking at the numbers and character strings that define a dataset is rarely useful. To convince yourself, print and stare at the US murders data table:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dslabs)
data(murders)
head(murders)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##        state abb region population total
## 1    Alabama  AL  South    4779736   135
## 2     Alaska  AK   West     710231    19
## 3    Arizona  AZ   West    6392017   232
## 4   Arkansas  AR  South    2915918    93
## 5 California  CA   West   37253956  1257
## 6   Colorado  CO   West    5029196    65</code></pre>
<p>What do you learn from staring at this table? Even though it is a relatively straightforward table, we can’t <strong>learn</strong> anything. For starters, it is grossly abbreviated, though you could scroll through. In doing so, how quickly might you be able to determine which states have the largest populations? Which states have the smallest? How populous is a typical state? Is there a relationship between population size and total murders? How do murder rates vary across regions of the country? For most folks, it is quite difficult to extract this information just by looking at the numbers. In contrast, the answer to the questions above are readily available from examining this plot:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(ggrepel)

r &lt;- murders %&gt;%
  summarize(pop=sum(population), tot=sum(total)) %&gt;%
  mutate(rate = tot/pop*10^6) %&gt;% pull(rate)

murders %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total, label = abb)) +
  geom_abline(intercept = log10(r), lty=2, col=&quot;darkgrey&quot;) +
  geom_point(aes(color=region), size = 3) +
  geom_text_repel() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  xlab(&quot;Populations in millions (log scale)&quot;) +
  ylab(&quot;Total number of murders (log scale)&quot;) +
  ggtitle(&quot;US Gun Murders in 2010&quot;) +
  scale_color_discrete(name=&quot;Region&quot;) +
  theme_economist_white()</code></pre>

<p>We are reminded of the saying: “A picture is worth a thousand words”. Data visualization provides a powerful way to communicate a data-driven finding. In some cases, the visualization is so convincing that no follow-up analysis is required. You should consider visualization the most potent tool in your data analytics arsenal.</p>
<p>The growing availability of informative datasets and software tools has led to increased reliance on data visualizations across many industries, academia, and government. A salient example is news organizations, which are increasingly embracing <em>data journalism</em> and including effective <em>infographics</em> as part of their reporting.</p>
<p>A particularly salient example—given the current state of the world—is a Wall Street Journal article<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> showing data related to the impact of vaccines on battling infectious diseases. One of the graphs shows measles cases by US state through the years with a vertical line demonstrating when the vaccine was introduced.</p>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/wsj-vaccines-example-1.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>(Source: <a href="http://graphics.wsj.com/infectious-diseases-and-vaccines/">Wall Street Journal</a>)</p>
<p>Another striking example comes from a New York Times chart<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, which summarizes scores from the NYC Regents Exams. As described in
the article<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, these scores are collected for several reasons, including to determine if a student graduates from high school. In New York City you need a 65 to pass. The distribution of the test scores forces us to notice something somewhat problematic:</p>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/regents-exams-example-1.png" width="80%" /></p>
<p>(Source: <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2011/02/19/nyregion/19schoolsch/19schoolsch-popup.gif">New York Times</a> via Amanda Cox)</p>
<p>The most common test score is the minimum passing grade, with very few scores just below the threshold. This unexpected result is consistent with students close to passing having their scores bumped up.</p>
<p>This is an example of how data visualization can lead to discoveries which would otherwise be missed if we simply subjected the data to a battery of data analysis tools or procedures. Data visualization is the strongest tool of what we call <em>exploratory data analysis</em> (EDA). John W. Tukey<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, considered the father of EDA, once said,</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.”</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Many widely used data analysis tools were initiated by discoveries made via EDA. EDA is perhaps the most important part of data analysis, yet it is one that is often overlooked.</p>
<p>Data visualization is also now pervasive in philanthropic and educational organizations. In the talks New Insights on Poverty<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and The Best Stats You’ve Ever Seen<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>, Hans Rosling forces us to notice the unexpected with a series of plots related to world health and economics. In his videos, he uses animated graphs to show us how the world is changing and how old narratives are no longer true.</p>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/gampnider-example-plot-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>It is also important to note that mistakes, biases, systematic errors and other unexpected problems often lead to data that should be handled with care. Failure to discover these problems can give rise to flawed analyses and false discoveries. As an example, consider that measurement devices sometimes fail and that most data analysis procedures are not designed to detect these. Yet these data analysis procedures will still give you an answer. The fact that it can be difficult or impossible to notice an error just from the reported results makes data visualization particularly important.</p>
<p>Today, we will discuss the basics of data visualization and exploratory data analysis. We will use the <strong>ggplot2</strong> package to code. To learn the very basics, we will start with a somewhat artificial example: heights reported by students. Then we will cover the two examples mentioned above: 1) world health and economics and 2) infectious disease trends in the United States.</p>

<p>We also do not cover interactive graphics, a topic that is both too advanced for this course and too unweildy. Some useful resources for those interested in learning more can be found below, and you are encouraged to draw inspiration from those websites in your projects:</p>
