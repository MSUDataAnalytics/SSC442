## Requirements

Data analytics is inherently a hands-on endeavor. Accordingly, the final project for this class is hands-on. As per the overview page, the final project has the following elements:

1. For your final project in this class, you will analyze **existing data** in some area of interest to you.[^3] Aggregating data from multiple sources is strongly encouraged.

[^3]: Note that **existing** is taken to mean that you are not permitted to collect data by interacting with other people. That is not to say that you cannot gather data that previously has not been gathered into a single place---this sort of exercise is encouraged. But you cannot stand with a clipboard outside a store and count visitors (for instance).

2. You must visualize (at least) three **interesting** features of that data. Visualizations should aid the reader in understanding something about the data that might not be readily aparent.[^4]

3. You must come up with some analysis---using tools from the course---which relates your data to either a **prediction** or a **policy conclusion**. For example, if you collected data from Major League Baseball games, you could try to "predict" whether a left-hander was pitching based solely on the outcomes of the batsmen. If you assembled data from COVID lockdowns and unemployment, you could try to understand the labor market and its reaction to COVID. 

If you choose a **prediction** project, you should employ all of the tools we have learned regarding training and testing, and report the relevant measures of fit.

If you choose a **policy conclusion** project, you should explore the relationship you're studying. If you find that low-income workers were most likely to be laid off during COVID, you should examine if this corresponds to, say, industry of employment (e.g. "service jobs were worst hit, and are most likely the job held by low-income workers"). 

4. You will submit **three things** via D2L:

- A PDF of your report (see the outline below for details of what this needs to contain) rendered from your R Markdown using LaTeX as in our problem sets. You might want to write the prose-heavy sections in a word processor like Word or Google Docs and copy/paste the text into your `R` Markdown document, since RStudio doesn't have a nice spell checker or grammar checker. This should have *no visible `R` code, warnings, or messages in it*.  To do this, you must set `echo = FALSE` in the code chunk options `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, ...)` at the beginning of your document template before you knit.

- The same PDF as above, but with all the R code in it (set `echo = TRUE` at the beginning of your document and reknit the file). Please label files in an obvious way. I will usually grade from this document.

- A CSV file of your data; or a link to the data online if your code pulls from the internet. This must be a separate file titled "data.csv" or "data.txt" as applicable.

This project is due by **11:59 PM on the date listed on the Schedule** <span style="color: #81056F; font-weight: bold"> No late work will be accepted. For real. MSU has grading deadlines and I've given you every second that can be spared.</span>


**There is no final exam. This project is your final exam.**

The project will ***not*** be graded using a check system, and will be graded by me (the main instructor, not a TA). I will evaluate the following four elements of your project:

1. Technical skills: Was the project easy? Does it showcase mastery of data analysis? (20%)

2. Visual design: Was the information smartly conveyed and usable? Was it beautiful? (25%)

3. Analytic design: Was the analysis appropriate? Was it sensible, given the dataset? (20%)

4. Story: Did we learn something? Did you explore your findings sufficiently deeply? (25%)

5. Following instructions: Did you surpress `R` code as asked? Did you submit a separate datafile and label it correctly?  (10%)

If you've engaged with the course content and completed the exercises and mini projects throughout the course, you should do just fine with the final project.


## Teams


> My team sucks; how can I punish them for their lack of effort?

On this front, we will be more supportive. While you have to put up with your team regardless of their quality, you can indicate that your team members are not carrying their fair share by issuing a **strike**. This processs works as follows:
1. A team member systematically fails to exert effort on collaborative projects (for example, by not showing up for meetings or not communicating, or by simply leeching off others without contributing.)
2. Your frustration reaches a boiling point. You decide this has to stop. You decide to issue a **strike**
3. You send an email with the following information:
    - `Subject line:` [SSC442] Strike against [Last name of Recipient]
    - `Body:` You do **not** need to provide detailed reasoning. However, you must discuss the actions (plural) you took to remedy the situation before sending the strike email.

A strike is a serious matter, and will reduce that team member's grade on joint work by 10%. If any team-member gets strikes from all other members of his or her team, their grade will be reduced by 50%.

Strikes are *anonymous* so that you do not need to fear social retaliation. However, they are not anonymous to allow you to issue them without thoughtful consideration. Perhaps the other person has a serious issue that is preventing them from completing work (e.g., a relative passing away). Please be thoughtful in using this remedy and consider it a last resort.

<!-- > Do I really need to create a team GitHub repository? I don't like GitHub / programming/ work. -->

<!-- Yes, you need to become familiar with GitHub and you and your team will work in a central repository for mini-projects and your final project. -->

<!-- This is for two reasons. First, computer scientists spent a huge amount of time coming up with the solutions that are implemented in GitHub (and other flavors of `git`). Their efforts are largely dedicated toward solving a very concrete goal: how can two people edit the same thing at the same time without creating a ton of new issues. While you could use a paid variant of GitHub (e.g., you could all collaborate over the Microsoft Office suite as implemented by the 360 software that MSU provides), you'd ultimately have the following issues: -->
<!-- 1. The software doesn't support some file types. -->
<!-- 2. The software doesn't autosave versions.[^1] If someone accidentally deletes something, you're in trouble. -->
<!-- 3. You have to learn an entirely new system every time you change classes / universities / jobs, because said institute doesn't buy the product you love.[^2] -->

<!-- [^1]: Some products, of course, solve this problem a little bit. For example, Dropbox allows users to share files with ease (of any file type) and saves a (coarse) version history. However, Dropbox does not allow multiple users to work on the same file, and has no way of merging edits together. -->

<!-- [^2]: This logic is also why we utilize only free software in this course. It sucks to get really good at, say, `SAS` (as I did many years ago) only to realize that the software costs about $10000 and many firms are unwilling to spent that. We will try our best to avoid giving you dead-end skills. -->

> I'm on a smaller-than-normal team. Does this mean that I have to do more work?

Your instructors are able to count and are aware the teams are imbalanced. Evaluations of final projects will take this into account. While your final product should reflect the best ability of your team, we do not anticipate that the uneven teams will lead to substantively different outputs.



## Suggested outline

You must write and present your analysis as if presenting to a **C-suite executive**. If you are not familiar with this terminology, the C-suite includes, e.g., the CEO, CFO, and COO of a given company. Generally speaking, such executives are not particularly analytically oriented, and therefore your explanations need to be clear, consise (their time is valuable) and contain actionable (or valuable) information.[^6] The report should be no more than 3 pages (excluding figures and tables). 
    - Concretely, this requires a written memo, which describes the data, analyses, and results. This must be clear and easy to understand for a non-expert in your field. Figures and tables do not apply to the page limit. You must use headers (`#` at the beginning of a line for sections, `##` for subsections, etc.) for each of these sections. Make sure you inspect your final product before you upload it.

Below is a very loose guide to the sort of content that we expect for the final project.

[^6]: This exercise provides you with an opportunity to identify your marketable skills and to practice them. I encourage those who will be looking for jobs soon to take this exercise seriously.

### Introduction

Describe the motivation for this analysis. Briefly describe the dataset, and explain why the analysis you're undertaking matters for society. (Or matters for some decision-making. You should not feel constrained to asking only "big questions." The best projects will be narrow-scope but well-defined.) (**≈300 words**)


### Theory and Background

Provide in-depth background about the data of interest and about your analytics question. (**≈300 words**)

#### Theory

Provide some theoretical guidance to the functional relationship you hope to explore. If you're interested on how, say, height affects scoring in the NBA, write down a proposed function that might map height to scoring. Describe how you might look for this unknown relationship in the data, but do not describe the data yet. (**≈300 words**)

#### Hypotheses

Make predictions to form the questions that you will study. Declare what you think will happen (the *theory* section will explain the "why"). You should be able to reject or fail to reject these hypotheses based on your analyses. (**≈250 words**)

### Data and Analyses

#### Data

Given your motivations, limits on feasibility, and hypotheses, describe the data you use. (**≈100 words**)

#### Analyses

Generate the analyses relevant to your hypotheses and interests. Here you must include three figures and must describe what they contain in simple, easy to digest language. Why did you visualize these elements? Your analyses also must include brief discussion.

### Conclusion

What caveats should we consider? Do you believe this is a truly causal relationship? Or, if a predictive project, how well did you do and should we bet money / diagnose / rely on your prediction? Why does any of this matter to the decision-maker? (**≈75 words**)
