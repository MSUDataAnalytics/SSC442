### Weekly Writing Prompt

This weekly writing is for those who did not attend class.

This week's writing has two parts. First, consider examining political results in various legislative districts in Michigan. Suppose you ran a regression with a politician's vote share (as a percentage) as the target variable and the percent of various races or ethnicities in the voting district (e.g., white, black, indigenous people, Asian, etc.) as the right hand side variables. Brefily describe, in words, the interpretation of the coefficients. Second, write a short paragraph about any concerns you might have with this empirical approach.

As always, you **must** knit your output to a PDF and submit that to D2L. No word docs, no .Rmd documents. PDFs, please.
