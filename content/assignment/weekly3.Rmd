### Weekly Writing Prompt

First, you must find an example of a *bad* visualization (see this week’s lecture for ideas). You then must **generate** that visual. I completed a number of examples like this in class; see Content 4. You will have to make up some data in order to complete this (as I did in many of the examples covered in that lecture).

As always, you **must** knit your output to a PDF and submit that to D2L. No word docs, no .Rmd documents. PDFs, please.
