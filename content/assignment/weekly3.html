<h3>Weekly Writing Prompt</h3>
<p>This weekly writing is for those who did not attend class.</p>
<p>Complete the exercises in the first “Try It” box in this week’s Content. (If you’re having trouble locating that box, the first question begins “One ball will be drawn at random from a box containing: 3 cyan balls, 5 magenta balls, and 7 yellow balls.”)</p>
<div class="fyi">
<p>As always, you <strong>must</strong> knit your output to a PDF and submit that to D2L. No word docs, no .Rmd documents. PDFs, please.</p>
