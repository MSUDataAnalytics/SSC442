<h3>Weekly Writing Prompt</h3>
<p>First, you must find an example of a <em>bad</em> visualization (see this week’s lecture for ideas). You then must <strong>generate</strong> that visual. I completed a number of examples like this in class; see Content 4. You will have to make up some data in order to complete this (as I did in many of the examples covered in that lecture).</p>
<div class="fyi">
<p>As always, you <strong>must</strong> knit your output to a PDF and submit that to D2L. No word docs, no .Rmd documents. PDFs, please.</p>
