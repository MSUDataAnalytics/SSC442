## Data Wrangling

You work for a travel booking website as a data analyst. The hotel has asked your company for data on corporate bookings at the hotel via your site. Specifically, they have five corporations that are frequent customers of the hotel, and they want to know who spends the most with them. They've asked you to help out. Most of the corporate spending is in the form of room reservations, but there are also parking fees that the hotel wants included in the analysis. Your goal: total up spending by corporation and report the biggest and smallest spenders inclusive of rooms and parking.

Here's your data:

- [<i class="fas fa-file-csv"></i> `booking.csv`](/data/Lab11_booking.csv) - Contains the corporation name, the room type, and the dates someone from the corporation stayed at the hotel. It was pulled by an intern who doesn't understand date-time stamps. 

- [<i class="fas fa-file-csv"></i> `roomrates.csv`](/data/Lab11_roomrates.csv) - Contains the price of each room on each day. The Lab 11 version of this data is from our German affiliate, so pay attention to the date format!

- [<i class="fas fa-file-csv"></i> `parking.csv`](/data/Lab11_parking.csv) - Contains the corporations who negotiated free parking for employees. It has been updated.

- Parking at the hotel is \$60 if you don't have free parking. This hotel is in California, so everyone drives and parks when they stay.

__EXERCISE 1__

1. Total up spending by corporation and report the biggest and smallest spenders inclusive of rooms and parking

2. Visualize (using `ggplot`) the room rates over time by room type. Can you tell what factors determine room price? Note that we know each corporation gets the same room rate as the others on the same day, so this is about room rates, not corporate spending. Make **two** total plots, the first showing the room rates over time by room type, and the second explaining some feature of one of the room rates (e.g. when is the double room price high? When is it low?). Using the `month(...)` and `day(...)` functions from `lubridate` will help with figuring out the patterns.
