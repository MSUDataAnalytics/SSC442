I am an Assistant Professor at Michigan State University in the Department of Economics and a faculty affiliate in the Social Science Data Analytics Program. Prior to coming to MSU, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Harvard University and a Visiting Scholar at Harvard Business School. My research focuses on the intersection of psychology and economics -- also known as behavioral economics -- and has appeared in the American Economic Review and Neuron. Prior to coming to Michigan State University, I worked with the U.S. Army to help soldiers become more psychologically resilient.

I hold a Ph.D. in Social Science (Economics) from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and a B.S. in Economics  from the University of Oregon.
