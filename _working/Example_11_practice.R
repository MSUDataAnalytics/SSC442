## Data wrangling Example construction
## 
## 
## 3 data sets to process and merge
## ## First is a list of all Corporate bookings at a hotel. Room type, date (1 obs for each nights stay), employee ID
## ## Second is a list of all room rates, wide, with each date in a column and a row corresponding to room type
## ## Third is a list of all corporations with free parking

# students are to use the three datasets to answer the question: which corporation spends the most with the hotel?
# 
# books_use has the data on bookings but has no prices
# roomrates_use has the data on room prices, but in wide format (and with tricky column names)
# parking_use has the data on which ones have free parking (but missing any who don't so NA's in merge)
#

#     I also make a version for lab work building on the class exercises:
