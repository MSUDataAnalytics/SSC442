<h2>Backstory and Set Up</h2>
<p>You still work for Zillow as a junior analyst (sorry). But you’re hunting a promotion. Your job is to present some more advanced predictions for housing values in a small geographic area (Ames, IA) using this historical pricing.</p>
<p>As always, let’s load the data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Ames &lt;- read.table(&quot;https://msudataanalytics.github.io/SSC442/Labs/data/ames.csv&quot;,
                 header = TRUE,
                 sep = &quot;,&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="data-cleaning" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
<p>Oh, the Ames data yet again. It’s given us lots of trouble. Many of you have found a few variables (columns) that should be avoided. The main problem is that some columns have only one value in them, or they have only <code>NA</code> and one value, so once <code>lm(...)</code> drops the <code>NA</code> rows, they are left with only one value. Linear regression by OLS does not like variables that don’t vary! So, let’s be systematic about figuring out which columns in our data are to be avoided.</p>
<p>The <code>skimr</code> package is very helpful for seeing what our data contains. Install it, and then use <code>skim(Ames)</code> directly in the console (we’re just looking at data at the moment). Take a look at the “complete rate” column - this tells us the fraction of observations in that column that are <code>NA</code>. If it’s very small (see <code>Alley</code>), then that variable will be problematic. The “n_unique” column tells us if there are few or many different values - a “1” in “n_unique” is definitely going to be a problem!</p>
<p>You can make a note of those columns that have extremely low “complete rates” and drop them to start off. There are about 5-6 of them that will cause an error if we include them in a regression.</p>
</div>
<div id="linear-models" class="section level2">
<h2>Linear Models</h2>
<p>When exploring linear models in other classes, we often emphasize asymptotic results under distributional assumptions. That is, we make assumptions about the model in order to derive properties of large samples. This general approach is useful for creating and performing hypothesis tests. Frequently, when developing a linear regression model, part of the goal is to <strong>explain</strong> a relationship. However, this isn’t always the case. And it’s often not a valid approach, as we discussed in this week’s content.</p>
<p>So, we will ignore much of what we have learned in other classes (sorry, EC420) and instead simply use regression as a tool to <strong>predict</strong>. Instead of a model which supposedly explains relationships, we seek a model which minimizes <strong>errors</strong>.</p>
<p>To discuss linear models in the context of prediction, we return to the <code>Ames</code> data. Accordingly, you should utilize some of the early code from Lab 2 to hasten your progress in this lab.</p>
<div id="assesing-model-accuracy" class="section level3">
<h3>Assesing Model Accuracy</h3>
<p>There are many metrics to assess the accuracy of a regression model. Most of these measure in some way the average error that the model makes. The metric that we will be most interested in is the root-mean-square error.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{RMSE}(\hat{f}, \text{Data}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\displaystyle\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\left(y_i - \hat{f}(\bf{x}_i)\right)^2}
\]</span></p>
<p>While for the sake of comparing models, the choice between RMSE and MSE is arbitrary, we have a preference for RMSE, as it has the same units as the response variable. Also, notice that in the prediction context MSE refers to an average, whereas in an ANOVA context, the denominator for MSE may not be <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p>For a linear model , the estimate of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{f}\)</span>, is given by the fitted regression line.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\hat{y}({\bf{x}_i}) = \hat{f}({\bf{x}_i})
\]</span></p>
<p>We can write an <code>R</code> function that will be useful for performing this calculation.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rmse = function(actual, predicted) {
  sqrt(mean((actual - predicted) ^ 2))
}</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="model-complexity" class="section level3">
<h3>Model Complexity</h3>
<p>Aside from how well a model predicts, we will also be very interested in the complexity (flexibility) of a model. For now, we will only consider nested linear models for simplicity. Then in that case, the more predictors that a model has, the more complex the model. For the sake of assigning a numerical value to the complexity of a linear model, we will use the number of predictors, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>We write a simple <code>R</code> function to extract this information from a model.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>get_complexity = function(model) {
  length(coef(model)) - 1
}</code></pre>
<p>When deciding how complex of a model to use, we can utilize two techniques: <em>forward selection</em> or <em>backward selection</em>. Forward selection means that we start with the simplest model (with a single predictor) and then add one at a time until we decide to stop. Backward selection means that we start with the most complex model (with every available predictor) and then remove one at a time until we decide to stop. There are many criteria for “when to stop”. Below, we’ll try to give you some intuition on the model-building process.</p>
<div class="fyi">
<p><strong>EXERCISE 1</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Load the <code>Ames</code> data. Using <code>skimr::skim</code>, find the variables that have a complete rate of below 60% and drop them. 60% isn’t a magic number by any means, the “right” number is entirely dependent on your data. It is always standard practice to document the fields you have dropped from the data, so make sure you state which variables have been dropped.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a look at <code>Utilities</code>. Use the <code>table</code> function to see a tabulation of the values of <code>Utilities</code>. Do you see why this field is not likely to be useful to us, or even problematic?</p></li>
<li><p>Using <strong>forward selection</strong> (that is, select one variable, then select another) create a series of models up to complexity length 15. You may use any variable within the dataset, including categorical variables.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a chart plotting the model complexity as the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis variable and RMSE as the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis variable. Describe any patterns you see. Do you think you should use the full-size model? Why or why not? What criterion are you using to make this statement?</p></li>

<div id="test-train-split" class="section level3">
<h3>Test-Train Split</h3>
<p>There is an issue with fitting a model to all available data then using RMSE to determine how well the model predicts: it is essentially cheating. As a linear model becomes more complex, the RSS, thus RMSE, can never go up. It will only go down—or, in very specific cases where a new predictor is completely uncorrelated with the target, stay the same. This might seem to suggest that in order to predict well, we should use the largest possible model. However, in reality we have fit to a specific dataset, but as soon as we see new data, a large model may (in fact) predict poorly. This is called <strong>overfitting</strong>.</p>
<p>The most common approach to overfitting is to take a dataset of interest and split it in two. One part of the datasets will be used to fit (train) a model, which we will call the <strong>training</strong> data. The remainder of the original data will be used to assess how well the model is predicting, which we will call the <strong>test</strong> data. Test data should <em>never</em> be used to train a model—its pupose is to evaluate the fitted model once you’ve settled on something.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Here we use the <code>sample()</code> function to obtain a random sample of the rows of the original data. We then use those row numbers (and remaining row numbers) to split the data accordingly. Notice we used the <code>set.seed()</code> function to allow use to reproduce the same random split each time we perform this analysis. Sometimes we don’t want to do this; if we want to run lots of independent splits, then we do not need to set the initial seed.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(9)
num_obs = nrow(Ames)

train_index = sample(num_obs, size = trunc(0.50 * num_obs))
train_data = Ames[train_index, ]
test_data = Ames[-train_index, ]</code></pre>
<p>We will look at two measures that assess how well a model is predicting: <strong>train RMSE</strong> and <strong>test RMSE</strong>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{RMSE}_\text{Train} = \text{RMSE}(\hat{f}, \text{Train Data}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_{\text{Tr}}}\sum_{i \in \text{Train}}\left(y_i - \hat{f}(\bf{x}_i)\right)^2}
\]</span></p>
<p>Here <span class="math inline">\(n_{Tr}\)</span> is the number of observations in the train set. Train RMSE will still always go down (or stay the same) as the complexity of a linear model increases. That means train RMSE will not be useful for comparing models, but checking that it decreases is a useful sanity check.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{RMSE}_{\text{Test}} = \text{RMSE}(\hat{f}, \text{Test Data}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_{\text{Te}}}\sum_{i \in \text{Test}} \left ( y_i - \hat{f}(\bf{x}_i) \right ) ^2}
\]</span></p>
<p>Here <span class="math inline">\(n_{Te}\)</span> is the number of observations in the test set. Test RMSE uses the model fit to the training data, but evaluated on the unused test data. This is a measure of how well the fitted model will predict <strong>in general</strong>, not simply how well it fits data used to train the model, as is the case with train RMSE. What happens to test RMSE as the size of the model increases? That is what we will investigate.</p>
<p>We will start with the simplest possible linear model, that is, a model with no predictors.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fit_0 = lm(SalePrice ~ 1, data = train_data)
get_complexity(fit_0)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># train RMSE
sqrt(mean((train_data$SalePrice - predict(fit_0, train_data)) ^ 2))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 80875.98</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># test RMSE
sqrt(mean((test_data$SalePrice - predict(fit_0, test_data)) ^ 2))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 77928.62</code></pre>
<p>The previous two operations obtain the train and test RMSE. Since these are operations we are about to use repeatedly, we should use the function that we happen to have already written.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># train RMSE
rmse(actual = train_data$SalePrice, predicted = predict(fit_0, train_data))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 80875.98</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># test RMSE
rmse(actual = test_data$SalePrice, predicted = predict(fit_0, test_data))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 77928.62</code></pre>
<p>This function can actually be improved for the inputs that we are using. We would like to obtain train and test RMSE for a fitted model, given a train or test dataset, and the appropriate response variable.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>get_rmse = function(model, data, response) {
  rmse(actual = subset(data, select = response, drop = TRUE),
       predicted = predict(model, data))
}</code></pre>
<p>By using this function, our code becomes easier to read, and it is more obvious what task we are accomplishing.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>get_rmse(model = fit_0, data = train_data, response = &quot;SalePrice&quot;) # train RMSE</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 80875.98</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>get_rmse(model = fit_0, data = test_data, response = &quot;SalePrice&quot;) # test RMSE</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 77928.62</code></pre>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Apply this basic function with different arguments. Do you understand how we’ve nested functions within functions?</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Define a total of five models using the first five models you fit in Exercise 1. Define these as <code>fit_1</code> through <code>fit_5</code></p>
</div>
<div id="adding-flexibility-to-linear-models" class="section level3">
<h3>Adding Flexibility to Linear Models</h3>
<p>Each successive model we fit will be more and more flexible using both interactions and polynomial terms. We will see the training error decrease each time the model is made more flexible. We expect the test error to decrease a number of times, then eventually start going up, as a result of overfitting. To better understand the relationship between train RMSE, test RMSE, and model complexity, we’ll explore the results from Exercise 1.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you tried the in-line excercise above. If so, we can create a list of the models fit.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>model_list = list(fit_1, fit_2, fit_3, fit_4, fit_5)</code></pre>
<p>We then obtain train RMSE, test RMSE, and model complexity for each. In doing so, we’ll introduce a handy function from <code>R</code> called <code>sapply()</code>. You can likely intuit what it does by looking at the code below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>train_rmse = sapply(model_list, get_rmse, data = train_data, response = &quot;SalePrice&quot;)
test_rmse = sapply(model_list, get_rmse, data = test_data, response = &quot;SalePrice&quot;)
model_complexity = sapply(model_list, get_complexity)</code></pre>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Run <code>?sapply()</code> to understand what are valid arguments to the function.</p>
<p>Once you’ve done this, you’ll notice the following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># This is the same as the apply command above

test_rmse = c(get_rmse(fit_1, test_data, &quot;SalePrice&quot;),
              get_rmse(fit_2, test_data, &quot;SalePrice&quot;),
              get_rmse(fit_3, test_data, &quot;SalePrice&quot;),
              get_rmse(fit_4, test_data, &quot;SalePrice&quot;),
              get_rmse(fit_5, test_data, &quot;SalePrice&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>We can plot the results. If you execute the code below, you’ll see the train RMSE in blue, while the test RMSE is given in orange.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(model_complexity, train_rmse, type = &quot;b&quot;,
     ylim = c(min(c(train_rmse, test_rmse)) - 0.02,
              max(c(train_rmse, test_rmse)) + 0.02),
     col = &quot;dodgerblue&quot;,
     xlab = &quot;Model Size&quot;,
     ylab = &quot;RMSE&quot;)
lines(model_complexity, test_rmse, type = &quot;b&quot;, col = &quot;darkorange&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>We could also summarize the results as a table. <code>fit_1</code> is the least flexible, and <code>fit_5</code> is the most flexible. If we were to do this (see the exercise below) we would see that Train RMSE decreases as flexibility increases forever. However, this may not be the case for the Test RMSE.</p>

<p>A final note on the analysis performed here; we paid no attention whatsoever to the “assumptions” of a linear model. We only sought a model that <strong>predicted</strong> well, and paid no attention to a model for <strong>explaination</strong>. Hypothesis testing did not play a role in deciding the model, only prediction accuracy. Collinearity? We don’t care. Assumptions? Still don’t care. Diagnostics? Never heard of them. (These statements are a little over the top, and not completely true, but just to drive home the point that we only care about prediction. Often we latch onto methods that we have seen before, even when they are not needed.)</p>

Re-perform this analysis with a different seed value and the pattern may not hold. We will discuss why we expect this next chapter. We will discuss how we can help create this U-shape much later.
