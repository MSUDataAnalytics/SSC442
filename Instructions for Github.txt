Use the FS20.rproj, which opens as SSC442_SS21 in R.

Netlify is set to point to ajkirkpatrick/FS20 using the Spring2021 branch (can update if necessary)

The origin in GitHub in Rstudio points to MSUDataAnalytics/FS20, so pushing directly will create a Spring2021 branch on Ben's repository.
The remote "AJK" points ot my ajkirkpatrick/FS20, so the Spring2021 branch there will be what Netlify builds from.

To update MY FS20>Spring2021, make sure you are on the Spring2021 branch, then use terminal:

			git push AJK

This will push to my copy of Spring2021 and WILL NOT add the Spring2021 branch to thr origin (Ben's MSUDataAnalytics)
Go to netlify and deploy the website (might happen automatically). Make sure to commit .html files as well.
That should update it.

To commit everything, use terminal:

      git commit -a -m "commit message"
      
Use blogdown::hugo_build() which should update the public folders. Those are what Netlify cares about. Make sure all disappear from Git window if committing with -a
Once those are committed and pushed to AJK, netlify will automatically build and deploy within minutes.

When updating a .rmd, blogdown does not automatically put the whole thing together - e.g. it does not copy the graphics referred to in the .rmd into
the appropriate static/ directory (which is where it must be in order to be pulled by the *rendered* site). You can do it manually (e.g. refer to the 
place in /static where the file should be and copy it there). Or, I think you can have blogdown::build_site(build_rmd = rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()$path) 
build the .html of the page you're working on, and it should move the graphics you refer to in the project (content/example/assignment) .Rmd into
the right static location, and the reference on the site will be updated to the proper place.

    blogdown::build_site(build_rmd = rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()$path) INSTEAD of "knit". Just running build_site() does NOT automatically render the .Rmd!

Add'l note: hmmm, maybe you do have to render by clicking "knit". R-generated plots didn't show up running build_site(build_rm = rstudioapi::...). Hmmm
+++++++++++++++++++

Remember to NEVER use the PUSH button - that will create and update a fork on Ben's github (ugh).

Not sure what happens if you use "pull" - will it overwrite local files with the non-existent Spring2021 branch on Ben's? If there is no Spring2021 branch on Ben's, then it will jsut 
give an error.

To update, even without a good running hugo server, save the .Rmd, click "knit" to create the .html, then commit both of those. Use git push AJK to push it to Github. Netlify will AUTOMATICALLY re-deploy and update.

+++ Ben's code does not call dplyr::select. Ugh.
```{r, eval=T, echo=F, purl=F}
detach("package:dplyr")
library(dplyr)
```


++ schedule.yaml is in DATA


++ only works if you allow duplicate labels using options(knitr.duplicate.label = 'allow')
```{r, echo=F, purl = F}
knitr::purl(input = knitr::current_input(), documentation = 0, output = 'example-1-extracted-code.R', quiet = T)
```
