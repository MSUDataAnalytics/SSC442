      <h1 id="introduction-about-me">Introduction: About Me</h1>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> My primary area of expertise is psychology and economics.</p>
<p>This class is totally, unapologetically a work in progress.</p>
<p>Material is a mish-mash of stuff from:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Caltech (undergrad)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stanford University (graduate course)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harvard (graduate course)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip;so, yeah, it will be challenging. Hopefully, you&rsquo;ll find it fun!</p>
<p>My research: occasionally touches the topics in the course, but mostly utilizes things in the course as tools.</p>
<!-- slide -->
<h1 id="introduction-about-you">Introduction: About You</h1>
<p><em>New phone who dis?</em>  Please write down your</p>
<ul>
<li>name</li>
<li>major</li>
<li>desired graduation year and semester</li>
<li>interest in this course</li>
</ul>
<p>You <strong>must</strong> spend 5 minutes telling me a little bit about your interests before the end of the week.</p>
<!-- slide -->
<h1 id="introduction-this-course">Introduction: This Course</h1>
<p>The syllabus is posted on the course website</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll walk through highlights now, but read it later &ndash; it&rsquo;s long.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>But eventually, please read it. It is &ldquo;required.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Syllabus highlights:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grade is composed of problem sets, exams, and a written assignment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Attendance and Participation: 30%</li>
<li>Exams: 20%</li>
<li>Labs and Final Project: 50%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although exams are given a relatively low weight, you must attempt both exams to pass the course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Labs consist of a practical implementation of something we&rsquo;ve covered in the course (e.g., code your own Recommender System).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- slide -->
<h1 id="introduction-this-course-1">Introduction: This Course</h1>
<p>Grading: <strong>come to class.</strong></p>
<p>If you are the type of student that doesn&rsquo;t generally enjoy coming to class, this is not the course for you.</p>
<p>I suspect the exams will be much like my exams in my other course. Students have described those exams as ``painfully difficult&rdquo;. You are only <em>entitled</em> to the rubric on the previous slide.</p>
<p><strong>If</strong> you complete all assignments and attend all class dates, I will utilize the following curve for grading:</p>
<p><code>4.0</code> Came to class regularly, contributed substantive comments to discussions, did modestly well on exams, turned in all assignments.</p>
<p><code>3.5</code> Came to class regularly, said some stuff (sometimes interesting), did modestly poorly on exams, turned in all assignments.</p>
<p><code>3.0</code> Came to class regularly and said some stuff (mostly uninteresting), did very poorly on exams, turned in all assignments.</p>
<p><code>&lt; 3.0</code> Didn&rsquo;t come to class regularly or didn&rsquo;t turn in all assignments.</p>
<!-- slide -->
<h1 id="introduction-this-course-2">Introduction: This Course</h1>
<p>There are sort of three texts for this course and sort of zero.</p>
<p>The main text is free and available online (see syllabus or Google it). The secondary text is substantially more difficult, but also free online. The third text costs about $25.</p>
<p><strong>Please please please please please:</strong> Ask questions during class.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the material is quite hard.</li>
<li>Sometimes (often?) the material itself will be confusing or interesting&mdash;or both!</li>
<li>Think of your role as similar to a participant in a focus group.</li>
</ul>
<p>Return of the Please: If there is some topic that you really want to learn about, ask. If you are uncomfortable asking in front of the whole group, please see me during office hours.</p>
<!-- slide -->
<h1 id="introduction-this-course-3">Introduction: This Course</h1>
<p>Because this is a new course:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some of the lectures will be way too long or too short.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some (most?) of the lectures won&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of the time I&rsquo;ll forget what I intended to say and awkwardly stare at you for a few moments (sorry).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Comment <strong>throughout</strong> the course, not just at the end.</p>
<p>The material will improve with time and feedback.</p>
<p>I encourage measured feedback and thoughtful responses to questions. If I call on you and you don&rsquo;t know immediately, don&rsquo;t freak out. If you don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s totally okay to say you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<!-- slide -->
<h1 id="introduction-this-course-4">Introduction: This Course</h1>
<h3 id="super-big-important-explanation-of-the-course">SUPER BIG IMPORTANT EXPLANATION OF THE COURSE</h3>
<p>I teach using ``math&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&hellip;Don&rsquo;t be afraid. The math won&rsquo;t hurt you.</p>
<p>I fundamentally believe that true knowledge of how we learn from data depends on a basic understanding of the underlying mathematics.</p>
<p>-Good news: no black boxes.</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;ll <strong>actually learn</strong> stuff. (Probably. Hopefully?)</li>
<li>Also good news: level of required math is reasonably low. High-school algebra or equivalent should be fine.</li>
</ul>
<p>-Bad news: notation-heavy slides and reading.</p>
<!-- slide -->
<h1 id="introduction-this-course-5">Introduction: This Course</h1>
<p>Finally: I cannot address field-specific questions in areas outside economics to any satisfying degree.</p>
<p>Good news: I&rsquo;m good at knowing what I don&rsquo;t know and have a very small ego, which means that I&rsquo;m much less likely to blow smoke up your ass than other professors.</p>
<p>Bad news: I can&rsquo;t help with certain types of questions.</p>
<p>This course should be applicable broadly, but many of the examples will lean on my personal expertise (sorry).</p>
<!-- slide -->
<h1 id="last-intro-slide">Last Intro Slide</h1>
<p>Your &ldquo;assignment&rdquo;: read syllabus and Lab 0.</p>
<p>Things to stress from syllabus and Lab 0:</p>
<ul>
<li>E-mail isn&rsquo;t the ideal solution for technical problems</li>
<li>No appointments necessary for regularly scheduled office hours; or by appointment.</li>
<li>Can only reschedule exams (with good reason) if you tell me <strong>before</strong> the exam that you have a conflict.
<ul>
<li>Notify me immediately if you need accommodations because of RCPD or religious convictions; If you approach me at the last minute, I may not be able to help.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite my hard-assness in these intro slides: I&rsquo;m here to help and I am not in the business of giving bad grades for no reason.</p>
<!-- slide -->
<h1 id="what-is-data-analytics">What is &ldquo;Data Analytics&rdquo;?</h1>
<p>How do <strong>you</strong> define &ldquo;data analytics&rdquo;?  (Not a rhetorical question!)</p>
<ul>
<li>This course will avoid this nomenclature. It is confusing and imprecise. But you signed up (suckers) and I owe an explanation of what this course will cover.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some &ldquo;data analytics&rdquo; topics we will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear regression: <em>il classico</em>.</li>
<li>Models of classification or discrete choice.</li>
<li>Analysis of ``wide&rsquo;&rsquo; data.</li>
<li>Decision trees and other non-linear models.</li>
<li>Neural networks and other things that have deceptively cool names (not as fun as they sound).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="starting-point-for-this-course">Starting point for this course</h2>
<p>Better utilizing existing data can improve our predictive power whilst providing interpretable outputs for making policies.</p>

<h2 id="non-social-science-approaches-to-statistical-learning">Non-Social Science Approaches to Statistical Learning</h2>
<h3 id="a-brief-history">A Brief History</h3>
<p>Suppose you are a researcher and you want to teach a computer to recognize images of a tree.</p>
<p>Note: this is an ``easy&rdquo; problem. If you show pictures to a 3-year-old, that child will probably be able to tell you if there is a tree in the picture.</p>
<p>Computer scientists spent about 20 years on this problem because they thought about the problem like nerds and tried to write down a series of rules.</p>
<p>Rules are difficult to form, and simply writing rules misses the key insight: the data can tell you something.</p>
<!-- slide -->
<h2 id="social-science-approaches-to-statistical-learning">Social Science Approaches to Statistical Learning</h2>
<h3 id="a-brief-history-1">A Brief History</h3>
<p>Suppose you are a researcher and you want to know whether prisons reduce crime.</p>
<p>from ``A Call for a Moratorium on Prison Building&rsquo;&rsquo; (1976)</p>
<ul>
<li>Between 1955 and 1975, fifteen states increased the collective capacity of their adult prison systems by 56% (from, on average, 63,100 to 98,649).</li>
<li>Fifteen other states increased capacity by less than 4% (from 49,575 to 51,440).</li>
<li>In &ldquo;heavy-construction&rdquo; states the crime rate increased by 167%; in &ldquo;low-construction&rdquo; states the crime rate increased by 145%.</li>

<h1 id="the-pros-and-cons-of-correlation">The Pros and Cons of Correlation</h1>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nature gives you correlations for free.</li>
<li>In principle, everyone can agree on the facts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Correlations are not very helpful.</li>
<li>They show what has happened, but not why.</li>
<li>For many things, we care about why.</li>
</ul>
<!-- slide -->
<h2 id="why-a-correlation-exists-between-x-and-y">Why a Correlation Exists Between X and Y</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>$X \rightarrow Y$
X causes Y (causality)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$X \leftarrow Y$
Y causes X (reverse causality)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$Z \rightarrow X$; $Z \rightarrow Y$
Z causes X and Y (common cause)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$X \rightarrow Y$; $Y \rightarrow X$
X causes Y and Y causes X (simultaneous equations)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<!-- slide -->
<h2 id="uniting-social-science-and-computer-science">Uniting Social Science and Computer Science</h2>
<p>We will start in this course by examining situations where we do <strong>not</strong> care about why something has happened, but instead we care about our ability to predict its occurrence from existing data.</p>
<p>(But of course keep in back of mind that if you are making policy, you must care about why something happened).</p>
<p>We will also borrow a few other ideas from CS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anything is data
<ul>
<li>Satellite data</li>
<li>Unstructured text or audio</li>
<li>Facial expressions or vocal intonations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Subtle improvements on existing techniques</li>
<li>An eye towards practical implementability over ``cleanliness&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="a-case-study-in-prediction">A Case Study in Prediction</h1>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> a firm wishes to predict user behavior based on previous purchases or interactions.</p>

<h1 id="a-case-study-in-prediction-1">A Case Study in Prediction</h1>
<p>Small margins $\rightarrow$ huge payoffs.  $10% \rightarrow$ $1 million.</p>
<p>Not obvious why this was true for Netflix; quite obvious why this is true in financial markets.</p>
<h3 id="more-recent-examples-of-prediction">More Recent Examples of Prediction</h3>
<ul>
<li>Identify the risk factors for prostate cancer.</li>
<li>Classify a tissue sample into one of several cancer classes, based on a gene expression profile.</li>
<li>Classify a recorded phoneme based on a log-periodogram.</li>
<li>Predict whether someone will have a heart attack on the basis of demographic, diet and clinical measurements.</li>
<li>Customize an email spam detection system.</li>
<li>Identify a hand-drawn object.</li>
<li>Determine which oscillations of stellar luminosity are likely due to exoplanets.</li>
<li>Establish the relationship between salary and demographic variables in population survey data.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="an-aside-nomenclature">An Aside: Nomenclature</h1>
<p><strong>Machine learning</strong> arose as a subfield of Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>Statistical learning</strong> arose as a subfield of Statistics.</p>
<p>There is much overlap; however, a few points of distinction:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Machine learning has a greater emphasis on large scale applications and prediction accuracy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Statistical learning emphasizes models and their interpretability, and precision and uncertainty.</p>
<ul>
<li>But the distinction has become more and more blurred, and there is a great deal of &ldquo;cross-fertilization&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Obviously true:</strong> machine learning has the upper hand in marketing.</p>
<!-- slide -->
<h1 id="learning-from-data">Learning from Data</h1>
<p>The following are the basic requirements for statistical learning:</p>
<ol>
<li>A pattern exists.</li>
<li>This pattern is not easily expressed in a closed mathematical form.</li>
<li>You have data.</li>
</ol>
