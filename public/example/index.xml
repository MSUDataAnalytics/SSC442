&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probabilistic thinking is central in the human experience. How we describe that thinking is mixed, but most of the time we use (rather imprecise) language. With only a few moments of searching, one can find thousands of articles that use probabilistic words to describe events. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“‘Highly unlikely’ State of the Union will happen amid shutdown” – The Hill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tiger Woods makes Masters 15th and most improbable major” – Fox&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Trump predicts ‘very good chance’ of China trade deal” – CNN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet people don’t have a good sense of what these things mean. Uncertainty is key to data analytics: if we were certain of things, A study in the 1960s explored the perception of probabilistic words like these among NATO officers. A more modern replication of this found the following basic pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/img/words.png&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deep, basic fact about humans is that we struggle to understand probabilities. But visualizing things can help. The graphic above shows the uncertainty about uncertainty (very meta). We can convey all manner of uncertainty with clever graphics. Today’s practical example works through some of the myriad of ways to visualize variable data. We’ll cover some territory that we’ve already hit, in hopes of locking in some key concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;part-1-statistical-inference-and-polls&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Part 1: Statistical Inference and Polls&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this Example we will describe, in some detail, how poll aggregators such as FiveThirtyEight use data to predict election outcomes. To understand how they do this, we first need to learn the basics of &lt;em&gt;Statistical Inference&lt;/em&gt;, the part of statistics that helps distinguish patterns arising from signal from those arising from chance. Statistical inference is a broad topic and here we go over the very basics using polls as a motivating example. To describe the concepts, we complement the mathematical formulas with Monte Carlo simulations and &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;polls&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Polls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opinion polling has been conducted since the 19th century. The general goal is to describe the opinions held by a specific population on a given set of topics. In recent times, these polls have been pervasive during presidential elections. Polls are useful when interviewing every member of a particular population is logistically impossible. The general strategy is to interview a smaller group, chosen at random, and then infer the opinions of the entire population from the opinions of the smaller group. Statistical theory is used to justify the process. This theory is referred to as &lt;em&gt;inference&lt;/em&gt; and it is the main topic of this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best known opinion polls are those conducted to determine which candidate is preferred by voters in a given election. Political strategists make extensive use of polls to decide, among other things, how to invest resources. For example, they may want to know in which geographical locations to focus their “get out the vote” efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elections are a particularly interesting case of opinion polls because the actual opinion of the entire population is revealed on election day. Of course, it costs millions of dollars to run an actual election which makes polling a cost effective strategy for those that want to forecast the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although typically the results of these polls are kept private, similar polls are conducted by news organizations because results tend to be of interest to the general public and made public. We will eventually be looking at such data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real Clear Politics&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an example of a news aggregator that organizes and publishes poll results. For example, they present the following poll results reporting estimates of the popular vote for the 2016 presidential election&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- (Source: [Real Clear Politics](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html)) --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although in the United States the popular vote does not determine the result of the presidential election, we will use it as an illustrative and simple example of how well polls work. Forecasting the election is a more complex process since it involves combining results from 50 states and DC and we will go into some detail on this later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s make some observations about the table above. First, note that different polls, all taken days before the election, report a different &lt;em&gt;spread&lt;/em&gt;: the estimated difference between support for the two candidates. Notice also that the reported spreads hover around what ended up being the actual result: Clinton won the popular vote by 2.1%. We also see a column titled &lt;strong&gt;MoE&lt;/strong&gt; which stands for &lt;em&gt;margin of error&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, we will show how the probability concepts we learned in the previous content can be applied to develop the statistical approaches that make polls an effective tool. We will learn the statistical concepts necessary to define &lt;em&gt;estimates&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;margins of errors&lt;/em&gt;, and show how we can use these to forecast final results relatively well and also provide an estimate of the precision of our forecast. Once we learn this, we will be able to understand two concepts that are ubiquitous in data science: &lt;em&gt;confidence intervals&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;p-values&lt;/em&gt;. Finally, to understand probabilistic statements about the probability of a candidate winning, we will have to learn about Bayesian modeling. In the final sections, we put it all together to recreate the simplified version of the FiveThirtyEight model and apply it to the 2016 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start by connecting probability theory to the task of using polls to learn about a population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-sampling-model-for-polls&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The sampling model for polls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help us understand the connection between polls and what we have learned, let’s construct a similar situation to the one pollsters face. To mimic the challenge real pollsters face in terms of competing with other pollsters for media attention, we will use an urn full of beads to represent voters and pretend we are competing for a $25 dollar prize. The challenge is to guess the spread between the proportion of blue and red beads in this hypothetical urn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before making a prediction, you can take a sample (with replacement) from the urn. To mimic the fact that running polls is expensive, it costs you 10 cents per each bead you sample. Therefore, if your sample size is 250, and you win, you will break even since you will pay \$25 to collect your \$25 prize. Your entry into the competition can be an interval. If the interval you submit contains the true proportion, you get half what you paid and pass to the second phase of the competition. In the second phase, the entry with the smallest interval is selected as the winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;dslabs&lt;/strong&gt; package includes a function that shows a random draw from this urn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
take_poll(25)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/first-simulated-poll-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about how you would construct your interval based on the data shown above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have just described a simple sampling model for opinion polls. The beads inside the urn represent the individuals that will vote on election day. Those that will vote for the Republican candidate are represented with red beads and the Democrats with the blue beads. For simplicity, assume there are no other colors. That is, that there are just two parties: Republican and Democratic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;populations-samples-parameters-and-estimates&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Populations, samples, parameters, and estimates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to predict the proportion of blue beads in the urn. Let’s call this quantity &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;, which then tells us the proportion of red beads &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(1-p\)&lt;/span&gt;, and the spread &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p - (1-p)\)&lt;/span&gt;, which simplifies to &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(2p - 1\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In statistical textbooks, the beads in the urn are called the &lt;em&gt;population&lt;/em&gt;. The proportion of blue beads in the population &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; is called a &lt;em&gt;parameter&lt;/em&gt;. The 25 beads we see in the previous plot are called a &lt;em&gt;sample&lt;/em&gt;. The task of statistical inference is to predict the parameter &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; using the observed data in the sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we do this with the 25 observations above? It is certainly informative. For example, given that we see 13 red and 12 blue beads, it is unlikely that &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; .9 or &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; .1. But are we ready to predict with certainty that there are more red beads than blue in the jar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to construct an estimate of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; using only the information we observe. An estimate should be thought of as a summary of the observed data that we think is informative about the parameter of interest. It seems intuitive to think that the proportion of blue beads in the sample &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(0.48\)&lt;/span&gt; must be at least related to the actual proportion &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;. But do we simply predict &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; to be 0.48? First, remember that the sample proportion is a random variable. If we run the command &lt;code&gt;take_poll(25)&lt;/code&gt; four times, we get a different answer each time, since the sample proportion is a random variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/four-simulated-polls-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that in the four random samples shown above, the sample proportions range from 0.44 to 0.60. By describing the distribution of this random variable, we will be able to gain insights into how good this estimate is and how we can make it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-sample-average&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The sample average&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conducting an opinion poll is being modeled as taking a random sample from an urn. We are proposing the use of the proportion of blue beads in our sample as an &lt;em&gt;estimate&lt;/em&gt; of the parameter &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;. Once we have this estimate, we can easily report an estimate for the spread &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(2p-1\)&lt;/span&gt;, but for simplicity we will illustrate the concepts for estimating &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;. We will use our knowledge of probability to defend our use of the sample proportion and quantify how close we think it is from the population proportion &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start by defining the random variable &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; as: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X=1\)&lt;/span&gt; if we pick a blue bead at random and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X=0\)&lt;/span&gt; if it is red. This implies that the population is a list of 0s and 1s. If we sample &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(N\)&lt;/span&gt; beads, then the average of the draws &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X_1, \dots, X_N\)&lt;/span&gt; is equivalent to the proportion of blue beads in our sample. This is because adding the &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt;s is equivalent to counting the blue beads and dividing this count by the total &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(N\)&lt;/span&gt; is equivalent to computing a proportion. We use the symbol &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\bar{X}\)&lt;/span&gt; to represent this average. In general, in statistics textbooks a bar on top of a symbol means the average. The theory we just learned about the sum of draws becomes useful because the average is a sum of draws multiplied by the constant &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(1/N\)&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\bar{X} = 1/N \times \sum_{i=1}^N X_i\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For simplicity, let’s assume that the draws are independent: after we see each sampled bead, we return it to the urn. In this case, what do we know about the distribution of the sum of draws? First, we know that the expected value of the sum of draws is &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(N\)&lt;/span&gt; times the average of the values in the urn. We know that the average of the 0s and 1s in the urn must be &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;, the proportion of blue beads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we encounter an important difference with what we did in the Probability chapter: we don’t know what is in the urn. We know there are blue and red beads, but we don’t know how many of each. This is what we want to find out: we are trying to &lt;strong&gt;estimate&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;parameters&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Parameters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like we use variables to define unknowns in systems of equations, in statistical inference we define &lt;em&gt;parameters&lt;/em&gt; to define unknown parts of our models. In the urn model which we are using to mimic an opinion poll, we do not know the proportion of blue beads in the urn. We define the parameters &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; to represent this quantity. &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; is the average of the urn because if we take the average of the 1s (blue) and 0s (red), we get the proportion of blue beads. Since our main goal is figuring out what is &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;, we are going to &lt;em&gt;estimate this parameter&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideas presented here on how we estimate parameters, and provide insights into how good these estimates are, extrapolate to many data science tasks. For example, we may want to determine the difference in health improvement between patients receiving treatment and a control group. We may ask, what are the health effects of smoking on a population? What are the differences in racial groups of fatal shootings by police? What is the rate of change in life expectancy in the US during the last 10 years? All these questions can be framed as a task of estimating a parameter from a sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;polling-versus-forecasting&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Polling versus forecasting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we continue, let’s make an important clarification related to the practical problem of forecasting the election. If a poll is conducted four months before the election, it is estimating the &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; for that moment and not for election day. The &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; for election night might be different since people’s opinions fluctuate through time. The polls provided the night before the election tend to be the most accurate since opinions don’t change that much in a day. However, forecasters try to build tools that model how opinions vary across time and try to predict the election night results taking into consideration the fact that opinions fluctuate. We will describe some approaches for doing this in a later section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;properties-of-our-estimate-expected-value-and-standard-error&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Properties of our estimate: expected value and standard error&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how good our estimate is, we will describe the statistical properties of the random variable defined above: the sample proportion &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\bar{X}\)&lt;/span&gt;. Remember that &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\bar{X}\)&lt;/span&gt; is the sum of independent draws so the rules we covered in the probability chapter apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using what we have learned, the expected value of the sum &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(N\bar{X}\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(N \times\)&lt;/span&gt; the average of the urn, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;. So dividing by the non-random constant &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(N\)&lt;/span&gt; gives us that the expected value of the average &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\bar{X}\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;. We can write it using our mathematical notation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\mbox{E}(\bar{X}) = p
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also use what we learned to figure out the standard error: the standard error of the sum is &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\sqrt{N} \times\)&lt;/span&gt; the standard deviation of the urn. Can we compute the standard error of the urn? We learned a formula that tells us that it is &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\((1-0) \sqrt{p (1-p)}\)&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\sqrt{p (1-p)}\)&lt;/span&gt;. Because we are dividing the sum by &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(N\)&lt;/span&gt;, we arrive at the following formula for the standard error of the average:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\mbox{SE}(\bar{X}) = \sqrt{p(1-p)/N}
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result reveals the power of polls. The expected value of the sample proportion &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\bar{X}\)&lt;/span&gt; is the parameter of interest &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; and we can make the standard error as small as we want by increasing &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(N\)&lt;/span&gt;. The law of large numbers tells us that with a large enough poll, our estimate converges to &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take a large enough poll to make our standard error about 1%, we will be quite certain about who will win. But how large does the poll have to be for the standard error to be this small?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem is that we do not know &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;, so we can’t compute the standard error. However, for illustrative purposes, let’s assume that &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p=0.51\)&lt;/span&gt; and make a plot of the standard error versus the sample size &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(N\)&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/standard-error-versus-sample-size-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the plot we see that we would need a poll of over 10,000 people to get the standard error that low. We rarely see polls of this size due in part to costs. From the Real Clear Politics table, we learn that the sample sizes in opinion polls range from 500-3,500 people. For a sample size of 1,000 and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p=0.51\)&lt;/span&gt;, the standard error is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sqrt(p*(1-p))/sqrt(1000)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.01580823&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or 1.5 percentage points. So even with large polls, for close elections, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\bar{X}\)&lt;/span&gt; can lead us astray if we don’t realize it is a random variable. Nonetheless, we can actually say more about how close we get the &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;clt&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Central Limit Theorem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) tells us that the distribution function for a sum of draws is approximately normal. You also may recall that dividing a normally distributed random variable by a constant is also a normally distributed variable. This implies that the distribution of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\bar{X}\)&lt;/span&gt; is approximately normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, we have that &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\bar{X}\)&lt;/span&gt; has an approximately normal distribution with expected value &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; and standard error &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\sqrt{p(1-p)/N}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now how does this help us? Suppose we want to know what is the probability that we are within 1% from &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;. We are basically asking what is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\mbox{Pr}(| \bar{X} - p| \leq .01)
\]&lt;/span&gt;
which is the same as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\mbox{Pr}(\bar{X}\leq p + .01) - \mbox{Pr}(\bar{X} \leq p - .01)
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we answer this question? We can use the mathematical trick we learned in the previous chapter. Subtract the expected value and divide by the standard error to get a standard normal random variable, call it &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Z\)&lt;/span&gt;, on the left. Since &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; is the expected value and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\mbox{SE}(\bar{X}) = \sqrt{p(1-p)/N}\)&lt;/span&gt; is the standard error we get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\mbox{Pr}\left(Z \leq \frac{ \,.01} {\mbox{SE}(\bar{X})} \right) -
\mbox{Pr}\left(Z \leq - \frac{ \,.01} {\mbox{SE}(\bar{X})} \right)
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem we have is that since we don’t know &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;, we don’t know &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\mbox{SE}(\bar{X})\)&lt;/span&gt;. But it turns out that the CLT still works if we estimate the standard error by using &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\bar{X}\)&lt;/span&gt; in place of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;. We say that we &lt;em&gt;plug-in&lt;/em&gt; the estimate. Our estimate of the standard error is therefore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\hat{\mbox{SE}}(\bar{X})=\sqrt{\bar{X}(1-\bar{X})/N}
\]&lt;/span&gt;
In statistics textbooks, we use a little hat to denote estimates. The estimate can be constructed using the observed data and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(N\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we continue with our calculation, but dividing by &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{\mbox{SE}}(\bar{X})=\sqrt{\bar{X}(1-\bar{X})/N})\)&lt;/span&gt; instead. In our first sample we had 12 blue and 13 red so &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\bar{X} = 0.48\)&lt;/span&gt; and our estimate of standard error is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;x_hat &amp;lt;- 0.48
se &amp;lt;- sqrt(x_hat*(1-x_hat)/25)
se&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.09991997&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now we can answer the question of the probability of being close to &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;. The answer is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pnorm(0.01/se) - pnorm(-0.01/se)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.07971926&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, there is a small chance that we will be close. A poll of only &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(N=25\)&lt;/span&gt; people is not really very useful, at least not for a close election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier we mentioned the &lt;em&gt;margin of error&lt;/em&gt;. Now we can define it because it is simply two times the standard error, which we can now estimate. In our case it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;1.96*se&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.1958431&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we multiply by 1.96? Because if you ask what is the probability that we are within 1.96 standard errors from &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;, we get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\mbox{Pr}\left(Z \leq \, 1.96\,\mbox{SE}(\bar{X})  / \mbox{SE}(\bar{X}) \right) -
\mbox{Pr}\left(Z \leq - 1.96\, \mbox{SE}(\bar{X}) / \mbox{SE}(\bar{X}) \right)
\]&lt;/span&gt;
which is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\mbox{Pr}\left(Z \leq 1.96 \right) -
\mbox{Pr}\left(Z \leq - 1.96\right)
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which we know is about 95%:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pnorm(1.96)-pnorm(-1.96)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.9500042&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, there is a 95% probability that &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\bar{X}\)&lt;/span&gt; will be within &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(1.96\times \hat{SE}(\bar{X})\)&lt;/span&gt;, in our case within about 0.2, of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;. Note that 95% is somewhat of an arbitrary choice and sometimes other percentages are used, but it is the most commonly used value to define margin of error. We often round 1.96 up to 2 for simplicity of presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the CLT tells us that our poll based on a sample size of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(25\)&lt;/span&gt; is not very useful. We don’t really learn much when the margin of error is this large. All we can really say is that the popular vote will not be won by a large margin. This is why pollsters tend to use larger sample sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the table above, we see that typical sample sizes range from 700 to 3500. To see how this gives us a much more practical result, notice that if we had obtained a &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\bar{X}\)&lt;/span&gt;=0.48 with a sample size of 2,000, our standard error &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{\mbox{SE}}(\bar{X})\)&lt;/span&gt; would have been 0.0111714. So our result is an estimate of &lt;code&gt;48&lt;/code&gt;% with a margin of error of 2%. In this case, the result is much more informative and would make us think that there are more red balls than blue. Keep in mind, however, that this is hypothetical. We did not take a poll of 2,000 since we don’t want to ruin the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;a-monte-carlo-simulation&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Monte Carlo simulation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we want to use a Monte Carlo simulation to corroborate the tools we have built using probability theory. To create the simulation, we would write code like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;B &amp;lt;- 10000
N &amp;lt;- 1000
x_hat &amp;lt;- replicate(B, {
  x &amp;lt;- sample(c(0,1), size = N, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1-p, p))
  mean(x)
})&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, of course, we don’t know &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;. We could construct an urn like the one pictured above and run an analog (without a computer) simulation. It would take a long time, but you could take 10,000 samples, count the beads and keep track of the proportions of blue. We can use the function &lt;code&gt;take_poll(n=1000)&lt;/code&gt; instead of drawing from an actual urn, but it would still take time to count the beads and enter the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we therefore do to corroborate theoretical results is to pick one or several values of &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; and run the simulations. Let’s set &lt;code&gt;p=0.45&lt;/code&gt;. We can then simulate a poll:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p &amp;lt;- 0.45
N &amp;lt;- 1000

x &amp;lt;- sample(c(0,1), size = N, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1-p, p))
x_hat &amp;lt;- mean(x)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this particular sample, our estimate is &lt;code&gt;x_hat&lt;/code&gt;. We can use that code to do a Monte Carlo simulation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;B &amp;lt;- 10000
x_hat &amp;lt;- replicate(B, {
  x &amp;lt;- sample(c(0,1), size = N, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1-p, p))
  mean(x)
})&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To review, the theory tells us that &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\bar{X}\)&lt;/span&gt; is approximately normally distributed, has expected value &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p=\)&lt;/span&gt; 0.45 and standard error &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\sqrt{p(1-p)/N}\)&lt;/span&gt; = 0.0157321. The simulation confirms this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mean(x_hat)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.4500761&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sd(x_hat)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.01579523&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A histogram and qq-plot confirm that the normal approximation is accurate as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/normal-approximation-for-polls-1.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, in real life we would never be able to run such an experiment because we don’t know &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;. But we could run it for various values of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(N\)&lt;/span&gt; and see that the theory does indeed work well for most values. You can easily do this by re-running the code above after changing &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-spread&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The spread&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competition is to predict the spread, not the proportion &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;. However, because we are assuming there are only two parties, we know that the spread is &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p - (1-p) = 2p - 1\)&lt;/span&gt;. As a result, everything we have done can easily be adapted to an estimate of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(2p - 1\)&lt;/span&gt;. Once we have our estimate &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\bar{X}\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{\mbox{SE}}(\bar{X})\)&lt;/span&gt;, we estimate the spread with &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(2\bar{X} - 1\)&lt;/span&gt; and, since we are multiplying by 2, the standard error is &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(2\hat{\mbox{SE}}(\bar{X})\)&lt;/span&gt;. Note that subtracting 1 does not add any variability so it does not affect the standard error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our 25 item sample above, our estimate &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;code&gt;.48&lt;/code&gt; with margin of error &lt;code&gt;.20&lt;/code&gt; and our estimate of the spread is &lt;code&gt;0.04&lt;/code&gt; with margin of error &lt;code&gt;.40&lt;/code&gt;. Again, not a very useful sample size. However, the point is that once we have an estimate and standard error for &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;, we have it for the spread &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(2p-1\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;bias-why-not-run-a-very-large-poll&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bias: why not run a very large poll?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For realistic values of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;, say from 0.35 to 0.65, if we run a very large poll with 100,000 people, theory tells us that we would predict the election perfectly since the largest possible margin of error is around 0.3%:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/standard-error-versus-p-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason is that running such a poll is very expensive. Another possibly more important reason is that theory has its limitations. Polling is much more complicated than picking beads from an urn. Some people might lie to pollsters and others might not have phones. But perhaps the most important way an actual poll differs from an urn model is that we actually don’t know for sure who is in our population and who is not. How do we know who is going to vote? Are we reaching all possible voters? Hence, even if our margin of error is very small, it might not be exactly right that our expected value is &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;. We call this bias. Historically, we observe that polls are indeed biased, although not by that much. The typical bias appears to be about 1-2%. This makes election forecasting a bit more interesting and we will talk about how to model this shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;part-2-supplemental-additional-visualization-techniques&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Part 2: (Supplemental) Additional Visualization Techniques&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this second part of the example, we’re going to use historical weather data from &lt;a href=&#34;https://darksky.net/forecast/33.7546,-84.39/us12/en&#34;&gt;Dark Sky&lt;/a&gt; about wind speed and temperature trends for downtown Atlanta (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/maps/place/33°45&amp;#39;16.4%22N+84°23&amp;#39;24.0%22W/@33.754557,-84.3921977,17z/&#34;&gt;specifically &lt;code&gt;33.754557, -84.390009&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) in 2019. We downloaded this data using Dark Sky’s (about-to-be-retired-because-they-were-bought-by-Apple) API using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hrbrmstr/darksky&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;darksky&lt;/strong&gt; package&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to follow along with this example, you can download the data below (you’ll likely need to right click and choose “Save Link As…”):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/data/atl-weather-2019.csv&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;fas fa-file-csv&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;code&gt;atl-weather-2019.csv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;code&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;load-and-clean-data&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Load and clean data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we load the libraries we’ll be using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggridges)
library(gghalves)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we load the data with &lt;code&gt;read_csv()&lt;/code&gt;. Here we assume that the CSV file lives in a subfolder in my project named &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;. Naturally, you’ll need to point this to wherever you stashed the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;weather_atl_raw &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;quot;data/atl-weather-2019.csv&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll add a couple columns that we can use for faceting and filling using the &lt;code&gt;month()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wday()&lt;/code&gt; functions from &lt;strong&gt;lubridate&lt;/strong&gt; for extracting parts of the date:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;weather_atl &amp;lt;- weather_atl_raw %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(Month = month(time, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE),
         Day = wday(time, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’re ready to go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;histograms&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Histograms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can first make a histogram of wind speed. We’ll use a bin width of 1 and color the edges of the bars white:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = windSpeed)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/basic-histogram-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is fine enough, but we can improve it by forcing the buckets/bins to start at whole numbers instead of containing ranges like 2.5–3.5. We’ll use the &lt;code&gt;boundary&lt;/code&gt; argument for that. We also add &lt;code&gt;scale_x_continuous()&lt;/code&gt; to add our own x-axis breaks instead of having things like 2.5, 5, and 7.5:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = windSpeed)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;, boundary = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 12, by = 1))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/basic-histogram-better-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can show the distribution of wind speed by month if we map the &lt;code&gt;Month&lt;/code&gt; column we made onto the fill aesthetic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = windSpeed, fill = Month)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;, boundary = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 12, by = 1))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/histogram-by-month-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is colorful, but it’s impossible to actually interpret. Instead of only filling, we’ll also facet by month to see separate graphs for each month. We can turn off the fill legend because it’s now redundant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = windSpeed, fill = Month)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;, boundary = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 12, by = 1)) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(vars(Month))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; = FALSE)` is deprecated. Please use `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; =
## &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;)` instead.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/histogram-by-month-facet-1.png&#34; width=&#34;768&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neat! January, March, and April appear to have the most variation in windy days, with a few wind-less days and a few very-windy days, while August was very wind-less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;density-plots&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Density plots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code to create a density plot is nearly identical to what we used for the histogram—the only thing we change is the &lt;code&gt;geom&lt;/code&gt; layer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = windSpeed)) +
  geom_density(color = &amp;quot;grey20&amp;quot;, fill = &amp;quot;grey50&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/basic-density-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want, we can mess with some of the calculus options like the kernel and bandwidth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = windSpeed)) +
  geom_density(color = &amp;quot;grey20&amp;quot;, fill = &amp;quot;grey50&amp;quot;,
               bw = 0.1, kernel = &amp;quot;epanechnikov&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/density-kernel-bw-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also fill by month. We’ll make the different layers 50% transparent so we can kind of see through the whole stack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = windSpeed, fill = Month)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/density-fill-by-month-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the transparency, this is really hard to interpret. We can fix this by faceting, like we did with the histograms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = windSpeed, fill = Month)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(vars(Month))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; = FALSE)` is deprecated. Please use `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; =
## &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;)` instead.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/density-facet-by-month-1.png&#34; width=&#34;768&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or we can stack the density plots behind each other with &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ggridges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For that to work, we also need to map &lt;code&gt;Month&lt;/code&gt; to the y-axis. We can reverse the y-axis so that January is at the top if we use the &lt;code&gt;fct_rev()&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = windSpeed, y = fct_rev(Month), fill = Month)) +
  geom_density_ridges() +
  guides(fill = FALSE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; = FALSE)` is deprecated. Please use `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; =
## &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;)` instead.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/ggridges-basic-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can add some extra information to &lt;code&gt;geom_density_ridges()&lt;/code&gt; with some other arguments like &lt;code&gt;quantile_lines&lt;/code&gt;. We can use the &lt;code&gt;quantiles&lt;/code&gt; argument to tell the plow how many parts to be cut into. Since we just want to show the median, we’ll set that to 2 so each density plot is divided in half:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = windSpeed, y = fct_rev(Month), fill = Month)) +
  geom_density_ridges(quantile_lines = TRUE, quantiles = 2) +
  guides(fill = FALSE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; = FALSE)` is deprecated. Please use `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; =
## &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;)` instead.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/ggridges-quantile-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have good working code, we can easily substitute in other variables by changing the x mapping:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = temperatureHigh, y = fct_rev(Month), fill = Month)) +
  geom_density_ridges(quantile_lines = TRUE, quantiles = 2) +
  guides(fill = FALSE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; = FALSE)` is deprecated. Please use `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; =
## &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;)` instead.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/ggridges-quantile-temp-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can get extra fancy if we fill by temperature instead of filling by month. To get this to work, we need to use &lt;code&gt;geom_density_ridges_gradient()&lt;/code&gt;, and we need to change the &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; mapping to the strange looking &lt;code&gt;..x..&lt;/code&gt;, which is a weird ggplot trick that tells it to use the variable we mapped to the x-axis. For whatever reason, &lt;code&gt;fill = temperatureHigh&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = temperatureHigh, y = fct_rev(Month), fill = ..x..)) +
  geom_density_ridges_gradient(quantile_lines = TRUE, quantiles = 2) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = &amp;quot;plasma&amp;quot;) +
  labs(x = &amp;quot;High temperature&amp;quot;, y = NULL, color = &amp;quot;Temp&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/ggridges-gradient-temp-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, we can get &lt;em&gt;extra&lt;/em&gt; fancy and show the distributions for both the high and low temperatures each month. To make this work, we need to manipulate the data a little. Right now there are two columns for high and low temperature: &lt;code&gt;temperatureLow&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;temperatureHigh&lt;/code&gt;. To be able to map temperature to the x-axis and high vs. low to another aesthetic (like &lt;code&gt;linetype&lt;/code&gt;), we need a column with the temperature and a column with an indicator variable for whether it is high or low. This data needs to be tidied (since right now we have a variable (high/low) encoded in the column name). We can tidy this data using &lt;code&gt;pivot_longer()&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;tidyr&lt;/strong&gt;, which was already loaded with &lt;code&gt;library(tidyverse)&lt;/code&gt;. In the RStudio primers, you did this same thing with &lt;code&gt;gather()&lt;/code&gt;—&lt;code&gt;pivot_longer()&lt;/code&gt; is the newer version of &lt;code&gt;gather()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;weather_atl_long &amp;lt;- weather_atl %&amp;gt;%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(temperatureLow, temperatureHigh),
               names_to = &amp;quot;temp_type&amp;quot;,
               values_to = &amp;quot;temp&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  # Clean up the new temp_type column so that &amp;quot;temperatureHigh&amp;quot; becomes &amp;quot;High&amp;quot;, etc.
  mutate(temp_type = recode(temp_type,
                            temperatureHigh = &amp;quot;High&amp;quot;,
                            temperatureLow = &amp;quot;Low&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;%
  # This is optional—just select a handful of columns
  select(time, temp_type, temp, Month)

# Show the first few rows
head(weather_atl_long)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 6 x 4
##   time                temp_type  temp Month  
##   &amp;lt;dttm&amp;gt;              &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ord&amp;gt;  
## 1 2019-01-01 05:00:00 Low        50.6 January
## 2 2019-01-01 05:00:00 High       63.9 January
## 3 2019-01-02 05:00:00 Low        49.0 January
## 4 2019-01-02 05:00:00 High       57.4 January
## 5 2019-01-03 05:00:00 Low        53.1 January
## 6 2019-01-03 05:00:00 High       55.3 January&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have a column for the temperature (&lt;code&gt;temp&lt;/code&gt;) and a column indicating if it is high or low (&lt;code&gt;temp_type&lt;/code&gt;). The dataset is also twice as long (730 rows) because each day has two rows (high and low). Let’s plot it and map high/low to the &lt;code&gt;linetype&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic to show high/low in the border of the plots:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl_long, aes(x = temp, y = fct_rev(Month),
                             fill = ..x.., linetype = temp_type)) +
  geom_density_ridges_gradient(quantile_lines = TRUE, quantiles = 2) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = &amp;quot;plasma&amp;quot;) +
  labs(x = &amp;quot;High temperature&amp;quot;, y = NULL, color = &amp;quot;Temp&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/ggridges-gradient-temp-high-low-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see much wider temperature disparities during the summer, with large gaps between high and low, and relatively equal high/low temperatures during the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;box-violin-and-rain-cloud-plots&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Box, violin, and rain cloud plots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can look at the distribution of variables with box plots, violin plots, and other similar graphs. First, we’ll make a box plot of windspeed, filled by the &lt;code&gt;Day&lt;/code&gt; variable we made indicating weekday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl,
       aes(y = windSpeed, fill = Day)) +
  geom_boxplot()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/basic-boxplot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can switch this to a violin plot by just changing the &lt;code&gt;geom&lt;/code&gt; layer and mapping &lt;code&gt;Day&lt;/code&gt; to the x-axis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl,
       aes(y = windSpeed, x = Day, fill = Day)) +
  geom_violin()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/basic-violin-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With violin plots it’s typically good to overlay other geoms. We can add some jittered points for a strip plot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl,
       aes(y = windSpeed, x = Day, fill = Day)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_point(size = 0.5, position = position_jitter(width = 0.1)) +
  guides(fill = FALSE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; = FALSE)` is deprecated. Please use `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; =
## &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;)` instead.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/violin-strip-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also add larger points for the daily averages. We’ll use a special layer for this: &lt;code&gt;stat_summary()&lt;/code&gt;. It has a slightly different syntax, since we’re not actually mapping a column from the dataset. Instead, we’re feeding a column from a dataset into a function (here &lt;code&gt;&#34;mean&#34;&lt;/code&gt;) and then plotting that result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl,
       aes(y = windSpeed, x = Day, fill = Day)) +
  geom_violin() +
  stat_summary(geom = &amp;quot;point&amp;quot;, fun = &amp;quot;mean&amp;quot;, size = 5, color = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5, position = position_jitter(width = 0.1)) +
  guides(fill = FALSE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; = FALSE)` is deprecated. Please use `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; =
## &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;)` instead.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/violin-strip-mean-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also show the mean and confidence interval at the same time by changing the summary function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl,
       aes(y = windSpeed, x = Day, fill = Day)) +
  geom_violin() +
  stat_summary(geom = &amp;quot;pointrange&amp;quot;, fun.data = &amp;quot;mean_se&amp;quot;, size = 1, color = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5, position = position_jitter(width = 0.1)) +
  guides(fill = FALSE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; = FALSE)` is deprecated. Please use `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; =
## &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;)` instead.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/violin-strip-mean-ci-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overlaying the points directly on top of the violins shows extra information, but it’s also really crowded and hard to read. If we use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/erocoar/gghalves&#34;&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;gghalves&lt;/strong&gt; package&lt;/a&gt;, we can use special halved versions of some of these geoms like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl,
       aes(x = fct_rev(Day), y = temperatureHigh)) +
  geom_half_point(aes(color = Day), side = &amp;quot;l&amp;quot;, size = 0.5) +
  geom_half_boxplot(aes(fill = Day), side = &amp;quot;r&amp;quot;) +
  guides(color = FALSE, fill = FALSE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; = FALSE)` is deprecated. Please use `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; =
## &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;)` instead.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/gghalves-point-boxplot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the &lt;code&gt;side&lt;/code&gt; argument for specifying which half of the column the geom goes. We can also use &lt;code&gt;geom_half_violin()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl,
       aes(x = fct_rev(Day), y = temperatureHigh)) +
  geom_half_point(aes(color = Day), side = &amp;quot;l&amp;quot;, size = 0.5) +
  geom_half_violin(aes(fill = Day), side = &amp;quot;r&amp;quot;) +
  guides(color = FALSE, fill = FALSE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; = FALSE)` is deprecated. Please use `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; =
## &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;)` instead.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/04-example_files/figure-html/gghalves-point-violon-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we flip the plot, we can make a &lt;a href=&#34;https://micahallen.org/2018/03/15/introducing-raincloud-plots/&#34;&gt;rain cloud plot&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl,
       aes(x = fct_rev(Day), y = temperatureHigh)) +
  geom_half_boxplot(aes(fill = Day), side = &amp;quot;l&amp;quot;, width = 0.5, nudge = 0.1) +
  geom_half_point(aes(color = Day), side = &amp;quot;l&amp;quot;, size = 0.5) +
  geom_half_violin(aes(fill = Day), side = &amp;quot;r&amp;quot;) +
  guides(color = FALSE, fill = FALSE) +
  coord_flip()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; = FALSE)` is deprecated. Please use `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; =
## &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;)` instead.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;adding-graphics-to-an-rmarkdown-file&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Adding graphics to an Rmarkdown file&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;from-the-web&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;From the web&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are incorporating an image (.png or .jpg) from another site on the web, you can refer to the image directly *provided the web address ends in &lt;code&gt;.png&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.jpg&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.gif&lt;/code&gt;. Google image search makes it a little hard to get directly to the image source, so click through a search until you get to the original image. Once you’re there, right-click on the image and select “Copy Image Address” (may vary by system). If you can paste the URL into a new window and get the image itself, you’re good to go with the instructions here. Some sites and formats do not host the images as a separate file – they may be generated by an app. For instance, if we go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://msu.edu/students&#34;&gt;https://msu.edu/students&lt;/a&gt;, the background image address is not available by right-clicking. But scrolling down, the image for the Student Information System is &lt;a href=&#34;https://student.msu.edu/&#34;&gt;https://student.msu.edu/&lt;/a&gt;. In cases where the image address is not readily available, you’ll have to take a screenshot and use the instructions in the next section (or dig into the site code if you know how to do that sort of thing). Let’s work on getting this image into our output: &lt;a href=&#34;https://msu.edu/-/media/assets/msu/images/audience-student/students-sis-home.jpg&#34;&gt;https://msu.edu/-/media/assets/msu/images/audience-student/students-sis-home.jpg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that using a web address for an image means if the image owner changes the address or removes the image, you won’t be able to re-knit your document. See the next section for downloading the image and inserting into your document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways of inserting an image: in markdown text, or in a code chunk. Both work. I prefer using the code chunk method, which uses &lt;code&gt;knitr::include_graphics&lt;/code&gt;. This is an R function, so you use it inside a code chunk. When you are including an image inside a code chunk, the code chunk options can be sued to control the &lt;code&gt;fig.width&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;fig.height&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;fig.align&lt;/code&gt;. Here’s the code starting with the code chunk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;images-inserted-in-code-chunks&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Images inserted in code chunks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{r insert-image, fig.width = 4, fig.align=&amp;#39;center&amp;#39;, echo = TRUE, eval = F}
knitr::include_graphics(path = &amp;quot;https://msu.edu/-/media/assets/msu/images/audience-student/students-sis-home.jpg&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://msu.edu/-/media/assets/msu/images/audience-student/students-sis-home.jpg&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;images-inserted-via-markdown&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Images inserted via Markdown&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markdown language is what controls the text outside of the R code chunks. It has its own way of inserting images. Here the image is inserted in the text, &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; in a code chunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;![](https://msu.edu/-/media/assets/msu/images/audience-student/students-sis-home.jpg&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://msu.edu/-/media/assets/msu/images/audience-student/students-sis-home.jpg%22&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;images-from-a-local-file&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Images from a local file&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you have the file on your hard drive already, right-click and download from the web to keep a copy for posterity, or save the image from a screenshot, you will often need to insert an image from a local file. In Rmarkdown, the path will always be &lt;em&gt;relative to the folder containing your .Rmd file&lt;/em&gt;. So if you keep your .Rmd in &lt;code&gt;/Users/jkirk/SSC442/Example3&lt;/code&gt; and you have a folder &lt;code&gt;/Users/jkirk/SSC442/Example3/images&lt;/code&gt; that contains a file &lt;code&gt;picture.png&lt;/code&gt;, then you would tell Rmarkdown to find the file at &lt;code&gt;./images/picture.png&lt;/code&gt; (which implies its filepath is &lt;code&gt;/Users/jkirk/SSC442/Example3/images/picture.png&lt;/code&gt;). The &lt;code&gt;./&lt;/code&gt; tells R to start looking in the local directory holding the .Rmd file you’re working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you know your local relative path, you can use either of the above methods &lt;code&gt;knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./images/picture.png&#39;)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;![](./images/picture.png)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible for R to find your image with an incorrect filepath when you click the “run chunk” button, but then not be able to find it when you knit. This can be very frustrating. It is almost always because you do not have the right &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt; filepath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;gapminder&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Data visualization in practice&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this chapter, we will demonstrate how relatively simple &lt;strong&gt;ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt; code can create insightful and aesthetically pleasing plots. As motivation we will create plots that help us better understand trends in world health and economics. We will implement what we learned in previous sections of the class and learn how to augment the code to perfect the plots. As we go through our case study, we will describe relevant general data visualization principles and learn concepts such as &lt;em&gt;faceting&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;time series plots&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;transformations&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;ridge plots&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;case-study-new-insights-on-poverty&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Case study: new insights on poverty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hans Rosling&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was the co-founder of the Gapminder Foundation&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an organization dedicated to educating the public by using data to dispel common myths about the so-called developing world. The organization uses data to show how actual trends in health and economics contradict the narratives that emanate from sensationalist media coverage of catastrophes, tragedies, and other unfortunate events. As stated in the Gapminder Foundation’s website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journalists and lobbyists tell dramatic stories. That’s their job. They tell stories about extraordinary events and unusual people. The piles of dramatic stories pile up in peoples’ minds into an over-dramatic worldview and strong negative stress feelings: “The world is getting worse!”, “It’s we vs. them!”, “Other people are strange!”, “The population just keeps growing!” and “Nobody cares!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hans Rosling conveyed actual data-based trends in a dramatic way of his own, using effective data visualization. This section is based on two talks that exemplify this approach to education: [New Insights on Poverty]&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and The Best Stats You’ve Ever Seen&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, in this section, we use data to attempt to answer the following two questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it a fair characterization of today’s world to say it is divided into western rich nations and the developing world in Africa, Asia, and Latin America?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has income inequality across countries worsened during the last 40 years?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, we will be using the &lt;code&gt;gapminder&lt;/code&gt; dataset provided in &lt;strong&gt;dslabs&lt;/strong&gt;. This dataset was created using a number of spreadsheets available from the Gapminder Foundation. You can access the table like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
library(ggrepel)
library(ggthemes)
gapminder = dslabs::gapminder %&amp;gt;% as_tibble()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;exploring-the-data&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Exploring the Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking an exercise from the &lt;em&gt;New Insights on Poverty&lt;/em&gt; video, we start by testing our knowledge regarding differences in child mortality across different countries. For each of the six pairs of countries below, which country do you think had the highest child mortality rates in 2015? Which pairs do you think are most similar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sri Lanka or Turkey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poland or South Korea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Malaysia or Russia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pakistan or Vietnam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thailand or South Africa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When answering these questions without data, the non-European countries are typically picked as having higher child mortality rates: Sri Lanka over Turkey, South Korea over Poland, and Malaysia over Russia. It is also common to assume that countries considered to be part of the developing world: Pakistan, Vietnam, Thailand, and South Africa, have similarly high mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions &lt;strong&gt;with data&lt;/strong&gt;, we can use &lt;strong&gt;dplyr&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, for the first comparison we see that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dslabs::gapminder %&amp;gt;%
  filter(year == 2015 &amp;amp; country %in% c(&amp;quot;Sri Lanka&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Turkey&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;%
  select(country, infant_mortality)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##     country infant_mortality
## 1 Sri Lanka              8.4
## 2    Turkey             11.6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey has the higher infant mortality rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use this code on all comparisons and find the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;table table-striped&#34; style=&#34;width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
country
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;
infant mortality
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
country
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;
infant mortality
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
Sri Lanka
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;
8.4
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
Turkey
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;
11.6
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
Poland
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;
4.5
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
South Korea
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;
2.9
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
Malaysia
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;
6.0
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
Russia
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;
8.2
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
Pakistan
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;
65.8
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
Vietnam
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;
17.3
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
Thailand
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;
10.5
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
South Africa
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;
33.6
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see that the European countries on this list have higher child mortality rates: Poland has a higher rate than South Korea, and Russia has a higher rate than Malaysia. We also see that Pakistan has a much higher rate than Vietnam, and South Africa has a much higher rate than Thailand. It turns out that when Hans Rosling gave this quiz to educated groups of people, the average score was less than 2.5 out of 5, worse than what they would have obtained had they guessed randomly. This implies that more than ignorant, we are misinformed. In this chapter we see how data visualization helps inform us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;slope-charts&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Slope charts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One exception where another type of plot may be more informative is when you are comparing variables of the same type, but at different time points and for a relatively small number of comparisons. For example, comparing life expectancy between 2010 and 2015. In this case, we might recommend a &lt;em&gt;slope chart&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no geometry for slope charts in &lt;strong&gt;ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt;, but we can construct one using &lt;code&gt;geom_line&lt;/code&gt;. We need to do some tinkering to add labels. We’ll paste together a character stright with the country name and the starting life expectancy, then do the same with just the later life expectancy for the right side. Below is an example comparing 2010 to 2015 for large western countries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;west &amp;lt;- c(&amp;quot;Western Europe&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Northern Europe&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Southern Europe&amp;quot;,
          &amp;quot;Northern America&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Australia and New Zealand&amp;quot;)

dat &amp;lt;- gapminder %&amp;gt;%
  filter(year%in% c(2010, 2015) &amp;amp; region %in% west &amp;amp;
           !is.na(life_expectancy) &amp;amp; population &amp;gt; 10^7) %&amp;gt;%
    mutate(label_first = ifelse(year == 2010, paste0(country, &amp;quot;: &amp;quot;, round(life_expectancy, 1), &amp;#39; years&amp;#39;), NA),
           label_last = ifelse(year == 2015,  paste0(round(life_expectancy, 1),&amp;#39; years&amp;#39;), NA))

dat %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(location = ifelse(year == 2010, 1, 2),
         location = ifelse(year == 2015 &amp;amp;
                             country %in% c(&amp;quot;United Kingdom&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Portugal&amp;quot;),
                           location+0.22, location),
         hjust = ifelse(year == 2010, 1, 0)) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(year = as.factor(year)) %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(year, life_expectancy, group = country)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = country), show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = label_first, color = country), direction = &amp;#39;y&amp;#39;, nudge_x = -1, seed = 1234, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = label_last, color = country), direction = &amp;#39;y&amp;#39;, nudge_x =  1, seed = 1234, show.legend = FALSE) +
  xlab(&amp;quot;&amp;quot;) + ylab(&amp;quot;Life Expectancy&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/03-example_files/figure-html/slope-plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An advantage of the slope chart is that it permits us to quickly get an idea of changes based on the slope of the lines. Although we are using angle as the visual cue, we also have position to determine the exact values. Comparing the improvements is a bit harder with a scatterplot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/03-example_files/figure-html/scatter-plot-instead-of-slope-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the scatterplot, we have followed the principle &lt;em&gt;use common axes&lt;/em&gt; since we are comparing these before and after. However, if we have many points, slope charts stop being useful as it becomes hard to see all the lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;bland-altman-plot&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bland-Altman plot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are primarily interested in the difference, it makes sense to dedicate one of our axes to it. The Bland-Altman plot, also known as the Tukey mean-difference plot and the MA-plot, shows the difference versus the average:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dat %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(year = paste0(&amp;quot;life_expectancy_&amp;quot;, year)) %&amp;gt;%
  select(country, year, life_expectancy) %&amp;gt;%
  spread(year, life_expectancy) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(average = (life_expectancy_2015 + life_expectancy_2010)/2,
         difference = life_expectancy_2015 - life_expectancy_2010) %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(average, difference, label = country)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel() +
  geom_abline(lty = 2) +
  xlab(&amp;quot;Average of 2010 and 2015&amp;quot;) +
  ylab(&amp;quot;Difference between 2015 and 2010&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/03-example_files/figure-html/bland-altman-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, by simply looking at the y-axis, we quickly see which countries have shown the most improvement. We also get an idea of the overall value from the x-axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;bump-charts&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bump charts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can make a bump chart that shows changes in rankings over time. We’ll look at fertility in South Asia. First we need to calculate a new variable that shows the rank of each country within each year. We can do this if we group by year and then use the &lt;code&gt;rank()&lt;/code&gt; function to rank countries by the &lt;code&gt;fertility&lt;/code&gt; column.&lt;/p&gt;

  filter(year &amp;gt;= 2004, year &amp;lt; 2015) %&amp;gt;%
  group_by(year) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(rank = rank(fertility))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then plot this with points and lines, reversing the y-axis so 1 is at the top:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(sa_fe, aes(x = year, y = rank, color = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_reverse(breaks = 1:8)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/03-example_files/figure-html/make-bump-plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran holds the number 1 spot, while Sri Lanka dropped from 2 to 6, and Bangladesh increased from 4 to 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the slopegraph, there are 8 different colors in the legend and it’s hard to line them all up with the different lines, so we can plot the text directly instead. We’ll use &lt;code&gt;geom_text()&lt;/code&gt; again. We don’t need to repel anything, since the text should fit in each row just fine. We need to change the &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; argument in &lt;code&gt;geom_text()&lt;/code&gt; though and filter the data to only include one year, otherwise we’ll get labels on every point, which is excessive. We can also adjust the theme and colors to make it cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bumpplot &amp;lt;- ggplot(sa_fe, aes(x = year, y = rank, color = country)) +
  geom_line(size = 2) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  geom_text(data = sa_fe %&amp;gt;% dplyr::filter(year==2004) %&amp;gt;% arrange(rank),
            aes(label = country, x = 2003), fontface = &amp;quot;bold&amp;quot;, angle = 45) +
 geom_text(data = sa_fe %&amp;gt;% dplyr::filter(year==2014) %&amp;gt;% arrange(rank),
            aes(label = country, x = 2015), fontface = &amp;quot;bold&amp;quot;, angle = 45) + 
  guides(color = FALSE) +
  scale_y_reverse(breaks = 1:8) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2004:2014) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;, begin = 0.2, end = 0.9) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = &amp;quot;Rank&amp;quot;)

&lt;p&gt;If you want to be &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; fancy, you can use flags instead of country codes, but that’s a little more complicated (you need to install the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rensa/ggflags&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ggflags&lt;/strong&gt; package&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://dominikkoch.github.io/Bump-Chart/&#34;&gt;See here for an example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;themes&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Themes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can go a little further towards a clean, easy-to-read data visualization by using &lt;strong&gt;themes&lt;/strong&gt; in our plots. Themes allow us to set a particular range of plot settings in one command, and let us further tweak things like fonts, background colors, and much more. We’ve used them in passing a few times without highlighting them, but we’ll discuss them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pre-constructed set of instructions for making a visual theme can be had by using a theme’s &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; function. Let’s look at two of my favorites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;theme_bw()&lt;/code&gt; uses the black-and-white theme, which is helpful in making a nice, clean plot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bumpplot + theme_bw()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The background shading is gone, which gives the plot a nice, crisp feel. It adds the black outline around the plot, but doesn’t mess with the colors in the plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;code&gt;theme_minimal()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bumpplot + theme_minimal()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Themes can alter things in the plot as well. If we really want to strip it down and remove the Y-axis (which is rarely a good idea, but in a bump chart, it makes sense):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bumpplot + theme_void()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;strong&gt;that’s&lt;/strong&gt; clean!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our opening unit, we had a plot that was styled after the plots in the magazine, &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;. That’s a theme (in the &lt;code&gt;ggthemes&lt;/code&gt; package that we loaded at the top)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bumpplot + theme_economist()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Themes affect some of the plot elements that we haven’t gotten much into (like length of axis ticks and the color of the panel grid behind the plot). We can use a theme, then make further changes to the theme. We won’t go into a lot of detail, but here’s an example. Use the &lt;code&gt;?theme&lt;/code&gt; to learn more about what you can change. Half the challenge is finding the right term for the thing you want to tweak! Theme changes occur in code order, so you can update a pre-set theme with your own details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bumpplot +   theme_bw() + theme(strip.text = element_text(face = &amp;quot;bold&amp;quot;),
                   plot.title = element_text(face = &amp;quot;bold&amp;quot;),
                   axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
                   panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(), # turn off all of the Y grid
                   panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
                   panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()) # turn off small x grid&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/03-example_files/figure-html/bump-plot-fancierest-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;small-multiples&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Small multiples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we can make some small multiples plots and show life expectancy over time for a handful of countries. We’ll make a list of some countries chosen at random while I scrolled through the data, and then filter our data to include only those rows. We then plot life expectancy, faceting by country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;life_expectancy_small &amp;lt;- gapminder %&amp;gt;%
  filter(country %in% c(&amp;quot;Argentina&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Bolivia&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Brazil&amp;quot;,
                        &amp;quot;Belize&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Canada&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Chile&amp;quot;))
ggplot(data = life_expectancy_small,
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = life_expectancy)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(vars(country))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small multiples! That’s all we need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do some fancier things, though. We can make this plot hyper minimalist with a &lt;strong&gt;theme&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = life_expectancy_small,
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = life_expectancy)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(vars(country), scales = &amp;quot;free_y&amp;quot;) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(face = &amp;quot;bold&amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/03-example_files/figure-html/life-expectancy-small-minimalist-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do a whole part of a continent (poor Syria 😞)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;life_expectancy_mena &amp;lt;- gapminder %&amp;gt;%
  filter(region == &amp;quot;Northern Africa&amp;quot; | region == &amp;quot;Western Asia&amp;quot;)

ggplot(data = life_expectancy_mena,
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = life_expectancy)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(vars(country), scales = &amp;quot;free_y&amp;quot;, nrow = 3) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(face = &amp;quot;bold&amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/03-example_files/figure-html/life-expectancy-mena-1.png&#34; width=&#34;960&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://hafen.github.io/geofacet/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;geofacet&lt;/strong&gt; package&lt;/a&gt; to arrange these facets by geography:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(geofacet)

life_expectancy_eu &amp;lt;- gapminder %&amp;gt;%
  filter(region== &amp;#39;Western Europe&amp;#39; | region==&amp;#39;Northern Europe&amp;#39; | region==&amp;#39;Southern Europe&amp;#39;)

ggplot(life_expectancy_eu, aes(x = year, y = life_expectancy)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  facet_geo(vars(country), grid = &amp;quot;europe_countries_grid1&amp;quot;, scales = &amp;quot;free_y&amp;quot;) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, title = &amp;quot;Life expectancy from 1960–2015&amp;quot;,
       caption = &amp;quot;Source: Gapminder&amp;quot;) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(face = &amp;quot;bold&amp;quot;),
        plot.title = element_text(face = &amp;quot;bold&amp;quot;),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-ecological-fallacy-and-importance-of-showing-the-data&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The ecological fallacy and importance of showing the data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this section, we have been comparing regions of the world. We have seen that, on average, some regions do better than others. In this section, we focus on describing the importance of variability within the groups when examining the relationship between a country’s infant mortality rates and average income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We define a few more regions and compare the averages across regions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/03-example_files/figure-html/ecological-fallacy-averages-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between these two variables is almost perfectly linear and the graph shows a dramatic difference. While in the West less than 0.5% of infants die, in Sub-Saharan Africa the rate is higher than 6%!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the plot uses a new transformation, the logistic transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;logit&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Logistic transformation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logistic or logit transformation for a proportion or rate &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; is defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[f(p) = \log \left( \frac{p}{1-p} \right)\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; is a proportion or probability, the quantity that is being logged, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p/(1-p)\)&lt;/span&gt;, is called the &lt;em&gt;odds&lt;/em&gt;. In this case &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; is the proportion of infants that survived. The odds tell us how many more infants are expected to survive than to die. The log transformation makes this symmetric. If the rates are the same, then the log odds is 0. Fold increases or decreases turn into positive and negative increments, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This scale is useful when we want to highlight differences near 0 or 1. For survival rates this is important because a survival rate of 90% is unacceptable, while a survival of 99% is relatively good. We would much prefer a survival rate closer to 99.9%. We want our scale to highlight these difference and the logit does this. Note that 99.9/0.1 is about 10 times bigger than 99/1 which is about 10 times larger than 90/10. By using the log, these fold changes turn into constant increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;show-the-data&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Show the data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, back to our plot. Based on the plot above, do we conclude that a country with a low income is destined to have low survival rate? Do we conclude that survival rates in Sub-Saharan Africa are all lower than in Southern Asia, which in turn are lower than in the Pacific Islands, and so on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jumping to this conclusion based on a plot showing averages is referred to as the &lt;em&gt;ecological fallacy&lt;/em&gt;. The almost perfect relationship between survival rates and income is only observed for the averages at the region level. Once we show all the data, we see a somewhat more complicated story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/03-example_files/figure-html/ecological-fallacy-all-data-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we see that there is a large amount of variability. We see that countries from the same regions can be quite different and that countries with the same income can have different survival rates. For example, while on average Sub-Saharan Africa had the worse health and economic outcomes, there is wide variability within that group. Mauritius and Botswana are doing better than Angola and Sierra Leone, with Mauritius comparable to Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;vaccines&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Case study: vaccines and infectious diseases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccines have helped save millions of lives. In the 19th century, before herd immunization was achieved through vaccination programs, deaths from infectious diseases, such as smallpox and polio, were common. However, today vaccination programs have become somewhat controversial despite all the scientific evidence for their importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy started with a paper&lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in 1988 and led by Andrew Wakefield claiming
there was a link between the administration of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and the appearance of autism and bowel disease.
Despite much scientific evidence contradicting this finding, sensationalist media reports and fear-mongering from conspiracy theorists led parts of the public into believing that vaccines were harmful. As a result, many parents ceased to vaccinate their children. This dangerous practice can be potentially disastrous given that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that vaccinations will prevent more than 21 million hospitalizations and 732,000 deaths among children born in the last 20 years (see Benefits from Immunization during the Vaccines for Children Program Era — United States, 1994-2013, MMWR&lt;a href=&#34;#fn6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref6&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).
The 1988 paper has since been retracted and Andrew Wakefield was eventually “struck off the UK medical register, with a statement identifying deliberate falsification in the research published in The Lancet, and was thereby barred from practicing medicine in the UK.” (source: Wikipedia&lt;a href=&#34;#fn7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref7&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Yet misconceptions persist, in part due to self-proclaimed activists who continue to disseminate misinformation about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective communication of data is a strong antidote to misinformation and fear-mongering. Earlier we used an example provided by a Wall Street Journal article&lt;a href=&#34;#fn8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref8&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; showing data related to the impact of vaccines on battling infectious diseases. Here we reconstruct that example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data used for these plots were collected, organized, and distributed by the Tycho Project&lt;a href=&#34;#fn9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref9&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They include weekly reported counts for seven diseases from 1928 to 2011, from all fifty states. The yearly totals are helpfully included in the &lt;strong&gt;dslabs&lt;/strong&gt; package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(RColorBrewer)
data(us_contagious_diseases)
names(us_contagious_diseases)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;disease&amp;quot;         &amp;quot;state&amp;quot;           &amp;quot;year&amp;quot;            &amp;quot;weeks_reporting&amp;quot;
## [5] &amp;quot;count&amp;quot;           &amp;quot;population&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We create a temporary object &lt;code&gt;dat&lt;/code&gt; that stores only the measles data, includes a per 100,000 rate, orders states by average value of disease and removes Alaska and Hawaii since they only became states in the late 1950s. Note that there is a &lt;code&gt;weeks_reporting&lt;/code&gt; column that tells us for how many weeks of the year data was reported. We have to adjust for that value when computing the rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;the_disease &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;Measles&amp;quot;
dat &amp;lt;- us_contagious_diseases %&amp;gt;%
  filter(!state%in%c(&amp;quot;Hawaii&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Alaska&amp;quot;) &amp;amp; disease == the_disease) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(rate = count / population * 10000 * 52 / weeks_reporting) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(state = reorder(state, rate))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now easily plot disease rates per year. Here are the measles data from California:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dat %&amp;gt;% filter(state == &amp;quot;California&amp;quot; &amp;amp; !is.na(rate)) %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(year, rate)) +
  geom_line() +
  ylab(&amp;quot;Cases per 10,000&amp;quot;)  +
  geom_vline(xintercept=1963, col = &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/03-example_files/figure-html/california-measles-time-series-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We add a vertical line at 1963 since this is when the vaccine was introduced [Control, Centers for Disease; Prevention (2014). CDC health information for international travel 2014 (the yellow book). p. 250. ISBN 9780199948505].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now can we show data for all states in one plot? We have three variables to show: year, state, and rate. In the WSJ figure, they use the x-axis for year, the y-axis for state, and color hue to represent rates. However, the color scale they use, which goes from yellow to blue to green to orange to red, can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our example, we want to use a sequential palette since there is no meaningful center, just low and high rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use the geometry &lt;code&gt;geom_tile&lt;/code&gt; to tile the region with colors representing disease rates. We use a square root transformation to avoid having the really high counts dominate the plot. Notice that missing values are shown in grey. Note that once a disease was pretty much eradicated, some states stopped reporting cases all together. This is why we see so much grey after 1980.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dat %&amp;gt;% ggplot(aes(year, state, fill = rate)) +
  geom_tile(color = &amp;quot;grey50&amp;quot;) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand=c(0,0)) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = brewer.pal(9, &amp;quot;Reds&amp;quot;), trans = &amp;quot;sqrt&amp;quot;) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=1963, col = &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        legend.position=&amp;quot;bottom&amp;quot;,
        text = element_text(size = 8)) +
  ggtitle(the_disease) +
  ylab(&amp;quot;&amp;quot;) + xlab(&amp;quot;&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/03-example_files/figure-html/vaccines-plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plot makes a very striking argument for the contribution of vaccines. However, one limitation of this plot is that it uses color to represent quantity, which we earlier explained makes it harder to know exactly how high values are going. Position and lengths are better cues. If we are willing to lose state information, we can make a version of the plot that shows the values with position. We can also show the average for the US, which we compute like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;avg &amp;lt;- us_contagious_diseases %&amp;gt;%
  filter(disease==the_disease) %&amp;gt;% group_by(year) %&amp;gt;%
  summarize(us_rate = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE) /
              sum(population, na.rm = TRUE) * 10000)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to make the plot we simply use the &lt;code&gt;geom_line&lt;/code&gt; geometry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dat %&amp;gt;%
  filter(!is.na(rate)) %&amp;gt;%
    ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(year, rate, group = state),  color = &amp;quot;grey50&amp;quot;,
            show.legend = FALSE, alpha = 0.2, size = 1) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(year, us_rate),  data = avg, size = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = &amp;quot;sqrt&amp;quot;, breaks = c(5, 25, 125, 300)) +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Cases per 10,000 by state&amp;quot;) +
  xlab(&amp;quot;&amp;quot;) + ylab(&amp;quot;&amp;quot;) +
  geom_text(data = data.frame(x = 1955, y = 50),
            mapping = aes(x, y, label=&amp;quot;US average&amp;quot;),
            color=&amp;quot;black&amp;quot;) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=1963, col = &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/03-example_files/figure-html/time-series-vaccines-plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, we could use color to represent the categorical value state, but it is hard to pick 50 distinct colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reproduce the image plot we previously made but for smallpox. For this plot, do not include years in which cases were not reported in 10 or more weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now reproduce the time series plot we previously made, but this time following the instructions of the previous question for smallpox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the state of California, make a time series plot showing rates for all diseases. Include only years with 10 or more weeks reporting. Use a different color for each disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now do the same for the rates for the US. Hint: compute the US rate by using summarize: the total divided by total population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;distributions&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Visualizing data distributions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout your education, you may have noticed that numerical data is often summarized with the &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; value. For example, the quality of a high school is sometimes summarized with one number: the average score on a standardized test. Occasionally, a second number is reported: the &lt;em&gt;standard deviation&lt;/em&gt;. For example, you might read a report stating that scores were 680 plus or minus 50 (the standard deviation). The report has summarized an entire vector of scores with just two numbers. Is this appropriate? Is there any important piece of information that we are missing by only looking at this summary rather than the entire list?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first data visualization building block is learning to summarize lists of factors or numeric vectors—the two primary data types that we encounter in data analytics. More often than not, the best way to share or explore this summary is through data visualization. The most basic statistical summary of a list of objects or numbers is its distribution. Once a vector has been summarized as a distribution, there are several data visualization techniques to effectively relay this information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, we first discuss properties of a variety of distributions and how to visualize distributions using a motivating example of student heights. We then discuss some principles of data visualizations more broadly, and introduce new ggplot geometries to help us along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;variable-types&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Variable types&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be working with two types of variables: categorical and numeric. Each can be divided into two other groups: categorical can be ordinal or not, whereas numerical variables can be discrete or continuous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When each entry in a vector comes from one of a small number of groups, we refer to the data as &lt;em&gt;categorical data&lt;/em&gt;. Two simple examples are sex (male or female) and regions (Northeast, South, North Central, West). Some categorical data can be ordered even if they are not numbers per se, such as spiciness (mild, medium, hot). In statistics textbooks, ordered categorical data are referred to as &lt;em&gt;ordinal&lt;/em&gt; data. In psychology, a number of different terms are used for this same idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of numerical data are population sizes, murder rates, and heights. Some numerical data can be treated as ordered categorical. We can further divide numerical data into continuous and discrete. Continuous variables are those that can take any value, such as heights, if measured with enough precision. For example, a pair of twins may be 68.12 and 68.11 inches, respectively. Counts, such as population sizes, are discrete because they have to be integers—that’s how we count.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;case-study-describing-student-heights&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Case study: describing student heights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we consider an artificial problem to help us illustrate the underlying concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretend that we have to describe the heights of our classmates to ET, an extraterrestrial that has never seen humans. As a first step, we need to collect data. To do this, we ask students to report their heights in inches. We ask them to provide sex information because we know there are two different distributions by sex. We collect the data and save it in the &lt;code&gt;heights&lt;/code&gt; data frame:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
data(heights)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to convey the heights to ET is to simply send him this list of 1050 heights. But there are much more effective ways to convey this information, and understanding the concept of a distribution will help. To simplify the explanation, we first focus on male heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;distribution-function&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Distribution function&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that, in some cases, the average and the standard deviation are pretty much all we need to understand the data. We will learn data visualization techniques that will help us determine when this two number summary is appropriate. These same techniques will serve as an alternative for when two numbers are not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most basic statistical summary of a list of objects or numbers is its distribution. The simplest way to think of a distribution is as a compact description of a list with many entries. This concept should not be new for readers of this book. For example, with categorical data, the distribution simply describes the proportion of each unique category. The sex represented in the heights dataset is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
##    Female      Male 
## 0.2266667 0.7733333&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This two-category &lt;em&gt;frequency table&lt;/em&gt; is the simplest form of a distribution. We don’t really need to visualize it since one number describes everything we need to know: 23% are females and the rest are males. When there are more categories, then a simple barplot describes the distribution. Here is an example with US state regions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/state-region-distribution-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular plot simply shows us four numbers, one for each category. We usually use barplots to display a few numbers. Although this particular plot does not provide much more insight than a frequency table itself, it is a first example of how we convert a vector into a plot that succinctly summarizes all the information in the vector. When the data is numerical, the task of displaying distributions is more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;cdf-intro&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cumulative distribution functions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerical data that are not categorical also have distributions. In general, when data is not categorical, reporting the frequency of each entry is not an effective summary since most entries are unique. In our case study, while several students reported a height of 68 inches, only one student reported a height of &lt;code&gt;68.503937007874&lt;/code&gt; inches and only one student reported a height &lt;code&gt;68.8976377952756&lt;/code&gt; inches. We assume that they converted from 174 and 175 centimeters, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistics textbooks teach us that a more useful way to define a distribution for numeric data is to define a function that reports the proportion of the data below &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(a\)&lt;/span&gt; for all possible values of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(a\)&lt;/span&gt;. This function is called the cumulative distribution function (CDF). In statistics, the following notation is used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[ F(a) = \mbox{Pr}(x \leq a) \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a plot of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(F\)&lt;/span&gt; for the male height data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/ecdf-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to what the frequency table does for categorical data, the CDF
defines the distribution for numerical data. From the plot, we can see that 16% of the values are below 65, since &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(F(66)=\)&lt;/span&gt; 0.1637931, or that 84% of the values are below 72, since &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(F(72)=\)&lt;/span&gt; 0.841133,
and so on. In fact, we can report the proportion of values between any two heights, say &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(a\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(b\)&lt;/span&gt;, by computing &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(F(b) - F(a)\)&lt;/span&gt;. This means that if we send this plot above to ET, he will have all the information needed to reconstruct the entire list. Paraphrasing the expression “a picture is worth a thousand words”, in this case, a picture is as informative as 812 numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final note: because CDFs can be defined mathematically—and absent any data—the word &lt;em&gt;empirical&lt;/em&gt; is added to make the distinction when data is used. We therefore use the term empirical CDF (eCDF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;geometries-for-describing-distributions&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Geometries for describing distributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we’ll introduce ggplot geometries useful for describing distributions (or for many other things).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;histograms&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Histograms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the CDF concept is widely discussed in statistics textbooks, the plot is actually not very popular in practice. The main reason is that it does not easily convey characteristics of interest such as: at what value is the distribution centered? Is the distribution symmetric? What ranges contain 95% of the values? I doubt you can figure these out from glancing at the plot above. Histograms are much preferred because they greatly facilitate answering such questions. Histograms sacrifice just a bit of information to produce plots that are much easier to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest way to make a histogram is to divide the span of our data into non-overlapping bins of the same size. Then, for each bin, we count the number of values that fall in that interval. The histogram plots these counts as bars with the base of the bar defined by the intervals. Here is the histogram for the height data splitting the range of values into one inch intervals: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\((49.5, 50.5],(50.5, 51.5],(51.5,52.5],(52.5,53.5],...,(82.5,83.5]\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;heights %&amp;gt;%
  filter(sex==&amp;quot;Male&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = height)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = &amp;quot;black&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/height-histogram-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we send this &lt;strong&gt;histogram&lt;/strong&gt; plot to some uninformed reader, she will immediately learn some important properties about our data. First, the range of the data is from 50 to 84 with the majority (more than 95%) between 63 and 75 inches. Second, the heights are close to symmetric around 69 inches. Also, by adding up counts, this reader could obtain a very good approximation of the proportion of the data in any interval. Therefore, the histogram above is not only easy to interpret, but also provides almost all the information contained in the raw list of 812 heights with about 30 bin counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What information do we lose? Note that all values in each interval are treated the same when computing bin heights. So, for example, the histogram does not distinguish between 64, 64.1, and 64.2 inches. Given that these differences are almost unnoticeable to the eye, the practical implications are negligible and we were able to summarize the data to just 23 numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;geom_histogram&lt;/code&gt; layer only requires one aesthetic mapping - the x-axis. This is because the y-axis is computed from counts of the x-axis. Giving an aesthetic mapping to an additional variable for y will result in an error. Using an aesthetic mapping like &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; will work - it’ll give you two histograms on top of each other. Try it! Try setting the &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic to .5 (not an aesthetic mapping) so you can see both layers when they overlap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;smoothed-density&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Smoothed density&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smooth density plots are aesthetically more appealing than histograms. &lt;code&gt;geom_density&lt;/code&gt; is the geometry that gives a smoothed density. Here is what a smooth density plot looks like for our heights data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;heights %&amp;gt;%
  filter(sex==&amp;quot;Male&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(height)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .2, fill= &amp;quot;#00BFC4&amp;quot;, color = &amp;#39;gray50&amp;#39;)  &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/example-of-smoothed-density-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this plot, we no longer have sharp edges at the interval boundaries and many of the local peaks have been removed. Also, the scale of the y-axis changed from counts to &lt;em&gt;density&lt;/em&gt;. That is, the area under the curve will add up to 1, so we can read it like a probability density.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the smooth densities, we have to understand &lt;em&gt;estimates&lt;/em&gt;, a topic we don’t cover until later. However, we provide a heuristic explanation to help you understand the basics so you can use this useful data visualization tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main new concept you must understand is that we assume that our list of observed values is a subset of a much larger list of unobserved values. In the case of heights, you can imagine that our list of 812 male students comes from a hypothetical list containing all the heights of all the male students in all the world measured very precisely. Let’s say there are 1,000,000 of these measurements. This list of values has a distribution, like any list of values, and this larger distribution is really what we want to report to ET since it is much more general. Unfortunately, we don’t get to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we make an assumption that helps us perhaps approximate it. If we had 1,000,000 values, measured very precisely, we could make a histogram with very, very small bins. The assumption is that if we show this, the height of consecutive bins will be similar. This is what we mean by smooth: we don’t have big jumps in the heights of consecutive bins. Below we have a hypothetical histogram with bins of size 1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/simulated-data-histogram-1-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smaller we make the bins, the smoother the histogram gets. Here are the histograms with bin width of 1, 0.5, and 0.1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/simulated-data-histogram-2-1.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smooth density is basically the curve that goes through the top of the histogram bars when the bins are very, very small. To make the curve not depend on the hypothetical size of the hypothetical list, we compute the curve on frequencies rather than counts. We do this by using the double-dot object &lt;code&gt;..density..&lt;/code&gt;. Objects surrounded by &lt;code&gt;..&lt;/code&gt; are objects that are &lt;em&gt;calculated by ggplot&lt;/em&gt;. If we look at &lt;code&gt;?geom_histogram&lt;/code&gt;, and go down to “Computed variables”, we see that we could use &lt;code&gt;..count..&lt;/code&gt; to get “number of points in a bin”; &lt;code&gt;..ncount..&lt;/code&gt; for the count scaled to a max of 1; or &lt;code&gt;..ndensity..&lt;/code&gt; which scales the density to a max of 1 (which is a strange one). We can manually set the y aesthetic mapping, which defaults to &lt;code&gt;..count..&lt;/code&gt;, to &lt;code&gt;..density..&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;x %&amp;gt;% ggplot(aes(x = height)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), binwidth = 0.1, color = &amp;quot;black&amp;quot;) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/simulated-density-1-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, back to reality. We don’t have millions of measurements. In this concrete example, we have 812 and we can’t make a histogram with very small bins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We therefore make a histogram, using bin sizes appropriate for our data and computing frequencies rather than counts, and we draw a smooth curve that goes through the tops of the histogram bars. The following plots (loosely) demonstrate the steps that the computer goes through to ultimately create a smooth density:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/smooth-density-2-1.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;interpreting-the-y-axis&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Interpreting the y-axis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that interpreting the y-axis of a smooth density plot is not straightforward. It is scaled so that the area under the density curve adds up to 1. If you imagine we form a bin with a base 1 unit in length, the y-axis value tells us the proportion of values in that bin. However, this is only true for bins of size 1. For other size intervals, the best way to determine the proportion of data in that interval is by computing the proportion of the total area contained in that interval. For example, here are the proportion of values between 65 and 68:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/area-under-curve-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proportion of this area is about
0.3,
meaning that about
30%
of male heights are between 65 and 68 inches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By understanding this, we are ready to use the smooth density as a summary. For this dataset, we would feel quite comfortable with the smoothness assumption, and therefore with sharing this aesthetically pleasing figure with ET, which he could use to understand our male heights data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;heights %&amp;gt;%
  filter(sex==&amp;quot;Male&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = height)) +
  geom_density(alpha=.2, fill= &amp;quot;#00BFC4&amp;quot;, color = &amp;#39;black&amp;#39;) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/example-of-smoothed-density-2-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the only aesthetic mapping is &lt;code&gt;x = height&lt;/code&gt;, while the fill and color are set as un-mapped aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;densities-permit-stratification&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Densities permit stratification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final note, we point out that an advantage of smooth densities over histograms for visualization purposes is that densities make it easier to compare two distributions. This is in large part because the jagged edges of the histogram add clutter. Here is an example comparing male and female heights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;heights %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(height, fill=sex)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2, color = &amp;#39;black&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/two-densities-one-plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the right argument, &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; automatically shades the intersecting region with a different color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;normal-distribution&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The normal distribution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Histograms and density plots provide excellent summaries of a distribution. But can we summarize even further? We often see the average and standard deviation used as summary statistics: a two-number summary! To understand what these summaries are and why they are so widely used, we need to understand the normal distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The normal distribution, also known as the bell curve and as the Gaussian distribution, is one of the most famous mathematical concepts in history. A reason for this is that approximately normal distributions occur in many situations, including gambling winnings, heights, weights, blood pressure, standardized test scores, and experimental measurement errors. There are explanations for this, but we describe these later. Here we focus on how the normal distribution helps us summarize data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than using data, the normal distribution is defined with a mathematical formula. For any interval &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\((a,b)\)&lt;/span&gt;, the proportion of values in that interval can be computed using this formula:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\mbox{Pr}(a &amp;lt; x &amp;lt; b) = \int_a^b \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}s} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{x-m}{s} \right)^2} \, dx\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to memorize or understand the details of the formula. But note that it is completely defined by just two parameters: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(m\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(s\)&lt;/span&gt;. The rest of the symbols in the formula represent the interval ends that we determine, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(a\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(b\)&lt;/span&gt;, and known mathematical constants &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\pi\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(e\)&lt;/span&gt;. These two parameters, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(m\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(s\)&lt;/span&gt;, are referred to as the &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; (also called the &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;) and the &lt;em&gt;standard deviation&lt;/em&gt; (SD) of the distribution, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distribution is symmetric, centered at the average, and most values (about 95%) are within 2 SDs from the average. Here is what the normal distribution looks like when the average is 0 and the SD is 1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/normal-distribution-density-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the distribution is defined by just two parameters implies that if a dataset is approximated by a normal distribution, all the information needed to describe the distribution can be encoded in just two numbers: the average and the standard deviation. We now define these values for an arbitrary list of numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a list of numbers contained in a vector &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, the average is defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;m &amp;lt;- sum(x) / length(x)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the SD is defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;s &amp;lt;- sqrt(sum((x-mu)^2) / length(x))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which can be interpreted as the average distance between values and their average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s compute the values for the height for males which we will store in the object &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;index &amp;lt;- heights$sex == &amp;quot;Male&amp;quot;
x &amp;lt;- heights$height[index]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pre-built functions &lt;code&gt;mean&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sd&lt;/code&gt; (note that for reasons explained later, &lt;code&gt;sd&lt;/code&gt; divides by &lt;code&gt;length(x)-1&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;length(x)&lt;/code&gt;) can be used here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;m &amp;lt;- mean(x)
s &amp;lt;- sd(x)
c(average = m, sd = s)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##   average        sd 
## 69.314755  3.611024&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a plot of the smooth density and the normal distribution with mean = 69.3 and SD = 3.6 plotted as a black line with our student height smooth density in blue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/data-and-normal-densities-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we can ask the question “is our height data approximately normally distributed?”. The normal distribution does appear to be quite a good approximation here. We now will see how well this approximation works at predicting the proportion of values within intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;standard-units&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Standard units&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For data that is approximately normally distributed, it is convenient to think in terms of &lt;em&gt;standard units&lt;/em&gt;. The standard unit of a value tells us how many standard deviations away from the average it is. Specifically, for a value &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; from a vector &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;, we define the value of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; in standard units as &lt;code&gt;z = (x - m)/s&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; the average and standard deviation of &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;, respectively. Why is this convenient?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First look back at the formula for the normal distribution and note that what is being exponentiated is &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(-z^2/2\)&lt;/span&gt; with &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(z\)&lt;/span&gt; equivalent to &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; in standard units. Because the maximum of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(e^{-z^2/2}\)&lt;/span&gt; is when &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(z=0\)&lt;/span&gt;, this explains why the maximum of the distribution occurs at the average. It also explains the symmetry since &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(- z^2/2\)&lt;/span&gt; is symmetric around 0. Second, note that if we convert the normally distributed data to standard units, we can quickly know if, for example, a person is about average (&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(z=0\)&lt;/span&gt;), one of the largest (&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(z \approx 2\)&lt;/span&gt;), one of the smallest (&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(z \approx -2\)&lt;/span&gt;), or an extremely rare occurrence (&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(z &amp;gt; 3\)&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(z &amp;lt; -3\)&lt;/span&gt;). Remember that it does not matter what the original units are, these rules apply to any data that is approximately normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In R, we can obtain standard units using the function &lt;code&gt;scale&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;z &amp;lt;- scale(x)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to see how many men are within 2 SDs from the average, we simply type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mean(abs(z) &amp;lt; 2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.9495074&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proportion is about 95%, which is what the normal distribution predicts! To further confirm that, in fact, the approximation is a good one, we can use quantile-quantile plots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;quantile-quantile-plots&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quantile-quantile plots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A systematic way to assess how well the normal distribution fits the data is to check if the observed and predicted proportions match. In general, this is the approach of the quantile-quantile plot (QQ-plot). If our heights distribution is really normal, then the 10th percentile of our heights data should be the same as the 10th percentile of a theoretical normal, as should the 20th, 30th, 33rd, 37.5th, etc. percentiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First let’s define the theoretical quantiles (percentiles) for the normal distribution. In statistics books we use the symbol &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\Phi(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; to define the function that gives us the probability of a standard normal distribution being smaller than &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt;. So, for example, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\Phi(-1.96) = 0.025\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\Phi(1.96) = 0.975\)&lt;/span&gt;. In R, we can evaluate &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\Phi\)&lt;/span&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;pnorm&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pnorm(-1.96)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.0249979&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inverse function &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\Phi^{-1}(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; gives us the &lt;em&gt;theoretical quantiles&lt;/em&gt; for the normal distribution. So, for example, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\Phi^{-1}(0.975) = 1.96\)&lt;/span&gt;. In R, we can evaluate the inverse of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\Phi\)&lt;/span&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;qnorm&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;qnorm(0.975)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 1.959964&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that these calculations are for the standard normal distribution by default (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1), but we can also define these for any normal distribution. We can do this using the &lt;code&gt;mean&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sd&lt;/code&gt; arguments in the &lt;code&gt;pnorm&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;qnorm&lt;/code&gt; function. For example, we can use &lt;code&gt;qnorm&lt;/code&gt; to determine quantiles of a distribution with a specific average and standard deviation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;qnorm(0.975, mean = 5, sd = 2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 8.919928&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the normal distribution, all the calculations related to quantiles are done without data, thus the name &lt;em&gt;theoretical quantiles&lt;/em&gt;. But quantiles can be defined for any distribution, including an empirical one. So if we have data in a vector &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt;, we can define the quantile associated with any proportion &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; as the &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(q\)&lt;/span&gt; for which the proportion of values below &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(q\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;. Using R code, we can define &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; as the value for which &lt;code&gt;mean(x &amp;lt;= q) = p&lt;/code&gt;. Notice that not all &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; have a &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(q\)&lt;/span&gt; for which the proportion is exactly &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;. There are several ways of defining the best &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(q\)&lt;/span&gt; as discussed in the help for the &lt;code&gt;quantile&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give a quick example, for the male heights data, we have that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mean(x &amp;lt;= 69.5)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.5147783&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So about 50% are shorter or equal to 69 inches. This implies that if &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p=0.50\)&lt;/span&gt; then &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(q=69.5\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of a QQ-plot is that if your data is well approximated by normal distribution then the quantiles of your data should be similar to the quantiles of a normal distribution. To construct a QQ-plot, we do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define a vector of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(m\)&lt;/span&gt; proportions &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p_1, p_2, \dots, p_m\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define a vector of quantiles &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(q_1, \dots, q_m\)&lt;/span&gt; for your data for the proportions &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p_1, \dots, p_m\)&lt;/span&gt;. We refer to these as the &lt;em&gt;sample quantiles&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define a vector of theoretical quantiles for the proportions &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p_1, \dots, p_m\)&lt;/span&gt; for a normal distribution with the same average and standard deviation as the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plot the sample quantiles versus the theoretical quantiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s construct a QQ-plot using R code. Start by defining the vector of proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p &amp;lt;- seq(0.005, 0.995, 0.01)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To obtain the quantiles from the data, we can use the &lt;code&gt;quantile&lt;/code&gt; function like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sample_quantiles &amp;lt;- quantile(x, p)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To obtain the theoretical normal distribution quantiles with the corresponding average and SD, we use the &lt;code&gt;qnorm&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;theoretical_quantiles &amp;lt;- qnorm(p, mean = mean(x), sd = sd(x))

df = data.frame(sample_quantiles, theoretical_quantiles)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see if they match or not, we plot them against each other and draw the identity line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = df, aes(x = theoretical_quantiles, y = sample_quantiles)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline() # a 45-degree line &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/qqplot-original-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that this code becomes much cleaner if we use standard units:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sample_quantiles &amp;lt;- quantile(z, p)
theoretical_quantiles &amp;lt;- qnorm(p)
df2 =  data.frame(sample_quantiles, theoretical_quantiles)

ggplot(data = df2, aes(x = theoretical_quantiles, y = sample_quantiles)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/qqplot-standardized-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above code is included to help describe QQ-plots. However, in practice it is easier to use the &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; geometry &lt;code&gt;geom_qq&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;heights %&amp;gt;% filter(sex == &amp;quot;Male&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(sample = scale(height))) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_abline()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While for the illustration above we used 100 quantiles, the default from the &lt;code&gt;geom_qq&lt;/code&gt; function is to use as many quantiles as data points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;percentiles&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Percentiles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we move on, let’s define some terms that are commonly used in exploratory data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Percentiles&lt;/em&gt; are special cases of &lt;em&gt;quantiles&lt;/em&gt; that are commonly used. The percentiles are the quantiles you obtain when setting the &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(0.01, 0.02, ..., 0.99\)&lt;/span&gt;. We call, for example, the case of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p=0.25\)&lt;/span&gt; the 25th percentile, which gives us a number for which 25% of the data is below. The most famous percentile is the 50th, also known as the &lt;em&gt;median&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the normal distribution the &lt;em&gt;median&lt;/em&gt; and average are the same, but this is generally not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another special case that receives a name are the &lt;em&gt;quartiles&lt;/em&gt;, which are obtained when setting &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p=0.25,0.50\)&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(0.75\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;other-geometries&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ggplot2 geometries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alhough we haven’t gone into detain about the &lt;strong&gt;ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt; package for data visualization, we now will briefly discuss some of the geometries involved in the plots above. We will discuss &lt;strong&gt;ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt; in (excruciating) detail later this week. For now, we will briefly demonstrate how to generate plots related to distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;barplots&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Barplots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To generate a barplot we can use the &lt;code&gt;geom_bar&lt;/code&gt; geometry. The default is to count the number of each category and draw a bar. Here is the plot for the regions of the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;murders %&amp;gt;% ggplot(aes(region)) + geom_bar()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/barplot-geom-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often already have a table with a distribution that we want to present as a barplot. Here is an example of such a table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;data(murders)
tab &amp;lt;- murders %&amp;gt;%
  count(region) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(proportion = n/sum(n))
tab&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##          region  n proportion
## 1     Northeast  9  0.1764706
## 2         South 17  0.3333333
## 3 North Central 12  0.2352941
## 4          West 13  0.2549020&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer want &lt;code&gt;geom_bar&lt;/code&gt; to count, but rather just plot a bar to the height provided by the &lt;code&gt;proportion&lt;/code&gt; variable. For this we need to provide &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; (the categories) and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; (the values) and use the &lt;code&gt;stat=&#34;identity&#34;&lt;/code&gt; option. This tells R to just use the actual value in &lt;code&gt;proportion&lt;/code&gt; for the y aesthetic. This is only necessary when you’re telling R that you have your own field (&lt;code&gt;proportion&lt;/code&gt;) that you want to use instead of just the count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;tab %&amp;gt;% ggplot(aes(x = region, y = proportion)) + geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/region-freq-barplot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;histograms-1&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Histograms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To generate histograms we use &lt;code&gt;geom_histogram&lt;/code&gt;. By looking at the help file for this function, we learn that the only required argument is &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, the variable for which we will construct a histogram. We dropped the &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; because we know it is the first argument.
The code looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;heights %&amp;gt;%
  filter(sex == &amp;quot;Female&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(height)) +
  geom_histogram()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we run the code above, it gives us a message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;stat_bin()&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;bins = 30&lt;/code&gt;. Pick better value with
&lt;code&gt;binwidth&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We previously used a bin size of 1 inch (of observed height), so the code looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;heights %&amp;gt;%
  filter(sex == &amp;quot;Female&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(height)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if for aesthetic reasons we want to add color, we use the arguments described in the help file. We also add labels and a title:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;heights %&amp;gt;%
  filter(sex == &amp;quot;Female&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(height)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;, col = &amp;quot;black&amp;quot;) +
  labs(x = &amp;quot;Male heights in inches&amp;quot;, title = &amp;quot;Histogram&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/height-histogram-geom-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;density-plots&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Density plots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a smooth density, we use the &lt;code&gt;geom_density&lt;/code&gt;. To make a smooth density plot with the data previously shown as a histogram we can use this code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;heights %&amp;gt;%
  filter(sex == &amp;quot;Female&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = height)) +
  geom_density()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fill in with color, we can use the &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;heights %&amp;gt;%
  filter(sex == &amp;quot;Female&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = height)) +
  geom_density(fill=&amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/ggplot-density-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change the smoothness of the density, we use the &lt;code&gt;adjust&lt;/code&gt; argument to multiply the default value by that &lt;code&gt;adjust&lt;/code&gt;. For example, if we want the bandwidth to be twice as big we use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;heights %&amp;gt;%
  filter(sex == &amp;quot;Female&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = height)) + 
  geom_density(fill=&amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;, adjust = 2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;boxplots&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Boxplots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The geometry for boxplot is &lt;code&gt;geom_boxplot&lt;/code&gt;. As discussed, boxplots are useful for comparing distributions. For example, below are the previously shown heights for women, but compared to men. For this geometry, we need arguments &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as the categories, and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; as the values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/female-male-boxplots-geom-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that our x-axis is a categorical variable. The order is determined by either the factor variable levels in &lt;code&gt;heights&lt;/code&gt; or, if no levels are set, in the order in which the &lt;code&gt;sex&lt;/code&gt; variable first encounters them. Later on, we’ll learn how to change the ordering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do much more with boxplots when we have more data. Right now, our &lt;code&gt;heights&lt;/code&gt; data has only two variables - &lt;code&gt;sex&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt;. Let’s say we took the measurements over two different years - 2010 and 2020. That’s not in our data, so &lt;strong&gt;purely for exposition&lt;/strong&gt;, we’ll add it by randomly drawing a year for each observation. We’ll do this with &lt;code&gt;sample&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;heights = heights %&amp;gt;%
  dplyr::mutate(year = sample(x = c(2010, 2020), size = n(), replace = TRUE, prob = c(.5, .5)))

head(heights)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##      sex height year
## 1   Male     75 2020
## 2   Male     70 2010
## 3   Male     68 2020
## 4   Male     74 2010
## 5   Male     61 2020
## 6 Female     65 2010&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s look at the boxplot of heights by sex, but broken out by year. We can do this by adding &lt;code&gt;year&lt;/code&gt; as an aesthetic mapping. Because our &lt;code&gt;year&lt;/code&gt; variable is an integer, R will start by thinking it’s a continuous numeric, but we want to treat it as a discrete variable. So, we wrap it in &lt;code&gt;as.factor()&lt;/code&gt; to force R to recognize it as a discrete variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;heights %&amp;gt;% ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = height, fill = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(fill = &amp;#39;Year&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/addYear-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have each sex broken out by year! Since we randomly assigned year to our data (and didn’t actually take samples in two different decades), the distribution between years and within sex is nearly identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we wanted to have &lt;code&gt;year&lt;/code&gt; on the x-axis, but then put the sex boxplots next to each other. This would let us compare the difference in heights by sex over the two sample years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;heights %&amp;gt;% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = height, fill = sex)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(fill = &amp;#39;Sex&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/addYear2-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woah. Wait. What? Remember, in our data, &lt;code&gt;class(heights$year)&lt;/code&gt; is numeric, so when we ask R to put &lt;code&gt;year&lt;/code&gt; on the x-axis, it thinks it’s plotting a number. It gives us a nonsense x-axis. How do we fix this? We force &lt;code&gt;as.factor(year)&lt;/code&gt; to tell R that yes, &lt;code&gt;year&lt;/code&gt; is a categorical variable. Note that we &lt;strong&gt;didn’t&lt;/strong&gt; have to use &lt;code&gt;as.factor(sex)&lt;/code&gt; - that’s because sex is already a categorical variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;heights %&amp;gt;% ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(year), y = height, fill = sex)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(fill = &amp;#39;Sex&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can see the height difference by sex, by year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will explore more with boxplots and colors in our next lecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;lecture-videos&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lecture Videos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video from this lecture will be &lt;a href=&#34;https://mediaspace.msu.edu/media/SSC442+-+Example+02+-+Jan+27th/1_m4no05nj?st=675&#34;&gt;available here around 3-6 days after class &lt;i class=&#34;fas fa-film&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;try-it&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Try it!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;fyi&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRY IT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by loading the &lt;strong&gt;dplyr&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt; library as well as the &lt;code&gt;murders&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;heights&lt;/code&gt; data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dslabs)
data(heights)
data(murders)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, create a new variable in &lt;code&gt;murders&lt;/code&gt; that has &lt;code&gt;murders_per_capita&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;murders = murders %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(........)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make a histogram of murders per capita. Use the default values for color and fill, but make sure you label the x-axis with a meaningful label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make the same histogram, but set the fill aesthetic to MSU Green and the color to black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do the same, but make it a smooth density plot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, plot the smooth density but use a &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic mapping so that each &lt;code&gt;region&lt;/code&gt;’s density is shown. Set a meaningful title on the legend, and make sure you make the density transparent so we can see all of the region’s densities (see &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, try making a boxplot to show the same data - the distribution across states of murders per capita by region. What is the average Northeastern state’s murder rate? What about the average Southern state?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that discrete numeric data can be considered ordinal. Although this is technically true, we usually reserve the term ordinal data for variables belonging to a small number of different groups, with each group having many members. In contrast, when we have many groups with few cases in each group, we typically refer to them as discrete numerical variables. So, for example, the number of packs of cigarettes a person smokes a day, rounded to the closest pack, would be considered ordinal, while the actual number of cigarettes would be considered a numerical variable. But, indeed, there are examples that can be considered both numerical and ordinal when it comes to visualizing data.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction to data visualization&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the numbers and character strings that define a dataset is rarely useful. To convince yourself, print and stare at the US murders data table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(dslabs)
data(murders)
head(murders)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##        state abb region population total
## 1    Alabama  AL  South    4779736   135
## 2     Alaska  AK   West     710231    19
## 3    Arizona  AZ   West    6392017   232
## 4   Arkansas  AR  South    2915918    93
## 5 California  CA   West   37253956  1257
## 6   Colorado  CO   West    5029196    65&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you learn from staring at this table? Even though it is a relatively straightforward table, we can’t &lt;strong&gt;learn&lt;/strong&gt; anything. For starters, it is grossly abbreviated, though you could scroll through. In doing so, how quickly might you be able to determine which states have the largest populations? Which states have the smallest? How populous is a typical state? Is there a relationship between population size and total murders? How do murder rates vary across regions of the country? For most folks, it is quite difficult to extract this information just by looking at the numbers. In contrast, the answer to the questions above are readily available from examining this plot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(ggrepel)

r &amp;lt;- murders %&amp;gt;%
  summarize(pop=sum(population), tot=sum(total)) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(rate = tot/pop*10^6) %&amp;gt;% pull(rate)

murders %&amp;gt;% ggplot(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total, label = abb)) +
  geom_abline(intercept = log10(r), lty=2, col=&amp;quot;darkgrey&amp;quot;) +
  geom_point(aes(color=region), size = 3) +
  geom_text_repel() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  xlab(&amp;quot;Populations in millions (log scale)&amp;quot;) +
  ylab(&amp;quot;Total number of murders (log scale)&amp;quot;) +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;US Gun Murders in 2010&amp;quot;) +
  scale_color_discrete(name=&amp;quot;Region&amp;quot;) +
  theme_economist_white()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are reminded of the saying: “A picture is worth a thousand words”. Data visualization provides a powerful way to communicate a data-driven finding. In some cases, the visualization is so convincing that no follow-up analysis is required. You should consider visualization the most potent tool in your data analytics arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growing availability of informative datasets and software tools has led to increased reliance on data visualizations across many industries, academia, and government. A salient example is news organizations, which are increasingly embracing &lt;em&gt;data journalism&lt;/em&gt; and including effective &lt;em&gt;infographics&lt;/em&gt; as part of their reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A particularly salient example—given the current state of the world—is a Wall Street Journal article&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; showing data related to the impact of vaccines on battling infectious diseases. One of the graphs shows measles cases by US state through the years with a vertical line demonstrating when the vaccine was introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/01-example_files/figure-html/wsj-vaccines-example-1.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Source: &lt;a href=&#34;http://graphics.wsj.com/infectious-diseases-and-vaccines/&#34;&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another striking example comes from a New York Times chart&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which summarizes scores from the NYC Regents Exams. As described in
the article&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, these scores are collected for several reasons, including to determine if a student graduates from high school. In New York City you need a 65 to pass. The distribution of the test scores forces us to notice something somewhat problematic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/01-example_files/figure-html/regents-exams-example-1.png&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Source: &lt;a href=&#34;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2011/02/19/nyregion/19schoolsch/19schoolsch-popup.gif&#34;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; via Amanda Cox)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common test score is the minimum passing grade, with very few scores just below the threshold. This unexpected result is consistent with students close to passing having their scores bumped up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an example of how data visualization can lead to discoveries which would otherwise be missed if we simply subjected the data to a battery of data analysis tools or procedures. Data visualization is the strongest tool of what we call &lt;em&gt;exploratory data analysis&lt;/em&gt; (EDA). John W. Tukey&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, considered the father of EDA, once said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many widely used data analysis tools were initiated by discoveries made via EDA. EDA is perhaps the most important part of data analysis, yet it is one that is often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data visualization is also now pervasive in philanthropic and educational organizations. In the talks New Insights on Poverty&lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and The Best Stats You’ve Ever Seen&lt;a href=&#34;#fn6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref6&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Hans Rosling forces us to notice the unexpected with a series of plots related to world health and economics. In his videos, he uses animated graphs to show us how the world is changing and how old narratives are no longer true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/01-example_files/figure-html/gampnider-example-plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important to note that mistakes, biases, systematic errors and other unexpected problems often lead to data that should be handled with care. Failure to discover these problems can give rise to flawed analyses and false discoveries. As an example, consider that measurement devices sometimes fail and that most data analysis procedures are not designed to detect these. Yet these data analysis procedures will still give you an answer. The fact that it can be difficult or impossible to notice an error just from the reported results makes data visualization particularly important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we will discuss the basics of data visualization and exploratory data analysis. We will use the &lt;strong&gt;ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt; package to code. To learn the very basics, we will start with a somewhat artificial example: heights reported by students. Then we will cover the two examples mentioned above: 1) world health and economics and 2) infectious disease trends in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is much more to data visualization than what we cover here. The following are references for those who wish to learn more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;ggplot2&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;ggplot2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploratory data visualization is perhaps the greatest strength of &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;. One can quickly go from idea to data to plot with a unique balance of flexibility and ease. For example, Excel may be easier than &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; for some plots, but it is nowhere near as flexible. &lt;code&gt;D3.js&lt;/code&gt; may be more flexible and powerful than &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;, but it takes much longer to generate a plot. One of the reasons we use &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; is its incredible flexibility &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this course, we will be creating plots using the &lt;strong&gt;ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref7&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other approaches are available for creating plots in &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;. In fact, the plotting capabilities that come with a basic installation of &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; are already quite powerful. There are also other packages for creating graphics such as &lt;strong&gt;grid&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;lattice&lt;/strong&gt;. We chose to use &lt;strong&gt;ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt; in this course because it breaks plots into components in a way that permits beginners to create relatively complex and aesthetically pleasing plots using syntax that is intuitive and comparatively easy to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason &lt;strong&gt;ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt; is generally more intuitive for beginners is that it uses a so-called “grammar of graphics”&lt;a href=&#34;#fn8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref8&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the letters &lt;em&gt;gg&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt;. This is analogous to the way learning grammar can help a beginner construct hundreds of different sentences by learning just a handful of verbs, nouns and adjectives without having to memorize each specific sentence. Similarly, by learning a handful of &lt;strong&gt;ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt; building blocks and its grammar, you will be able to create hundreds of different plots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason &lt;strong&gt;ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt; is easy for beginners is that its default behavior is carefully chosen to satisfy the great majority of cases and is visually pleasing. As a result, it is possible to create informative and elegant graphs with relatively simple and readable code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One limitation is that &lt;strong&gt;ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt; is designed to work exclusively with data tables in tidy format (where rows are observations and columns are variables). However, a substantial percentage of datasets that beginners work with are in, or can be converted into, this format. An advantage of this approach is that, assuming that our data is tidy, &lt;strong&gt;ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt; simplifies plotting code and the learning of grammar for a variety of plots. You should review the previous content about tidy data if you are feeling lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use &lt;strong&gt;ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt; you will have to learn several functions and arguments. These are hard to memorize, so we highly recommend you have the ggplot2 cheat sheet handy. You can get a copy here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf&#34;&gt;https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf&lt;/a&gt; or simply perform an internet search for “ggplot2 cheat sheet”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-components-of-a-graph&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The components of a graph&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will eventually construct a graph that summarizes the US murders dataset that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/01-example_files/figure-html/ggplot-example-plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can clearly see how much states vary across population size and the total number of murders. Not surprisingly, we also see a clear relationship between murder totals and population size. A state falling on the dashed grey line has the same murder rate as the US average. The four geographic regions are denoted with color, which depicts how most southern states have murder rates above the average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This data visualization shows us pretty much all the information in the data table. The code needed to make this plot is relatively simple. We will learn to create the plot part by part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in learning &lt;strong&gt;ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt; is to be able to break a graph apart into components. Let’s break down the plot above and introduce some of the &lt;strong&gt;ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt; terminology. The main five components to note are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data&lt;/strong&gt;: The US murders data table is being summarized. We refer to this as the &lt;strong&gt;data&lt;/strong&gt; component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geometry&lt;/strong&gt;: The plot above is a scatterplot. This is referred to as the
&lt;strong&gt;geometry&lt;/strong&gt; component. Other possible geometries are barplot, histogram, smooth densities, qqplot, boxplot, pie (ew!), and many, many more. We will learn about these later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aesthetic mapping&lt;/strong&gt;: The plot uses several visual cues to represent the information provided by the dataset. The two most important cues in this plot are the point positions on the x-axis and y-axis, which represent population size and the total number of murders, respectively. Each point represents a different observation, and we &lt;em&gt;map&lt;/em&gt; data about these observations to visual cues like x- and y-scale. Color is another visual cue that we map to region. We refer to this as the &lt;strong&gt;aesthetic mapping&lt;/strong&gt; component. How we define the mapping depends on what &lt;strong&gt;geometry&lt;/strong&gt; we are using.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annotations&lt;/strong&gt;: These are things like axis labels, axis ticks (the lines along the axis at regular intervals or specific points of interest), axis scales (e.g. log-scale), titles, legends, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Style&lt;/strong&gt;: An overall appearance of the graph determined by fonts, color palattes, layout, blank spaces, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also note that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The points are labeled with the state abbreviations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The range of the x-axis and y-axis appears to be defined by the range of the data. They are both on log-scales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are labels, a title, a legend, and we use the style of The Economist magazine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the flexibility and visualization power of &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; is contained in these four elements (plus your data)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;ggplot-objects&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; objects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will now construct the plot piece by piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start by loading the dataset:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(dslabs)
data(murders)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in creating a &lt;strong&gt;ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt; graph is to define a &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; object. We do this with the function &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt;, which initializes the graph. If we read the help file for this function, we see that the first argument is used to specify what data is associated with this object:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = murders)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also pipe the data in as the first argument. So this line of code is equivalent to the one above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;murders %&amp;gt;% ggplot()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/01-example_files/figure-html/ggplot-example-2-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It renders a plot, in this case a blank slate since no &lt;strong&gt;geometry&lt;/strong&gt; has been defined. The only style choice we see is a grey background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has happened above is that the object was created and, because it was not assigned, it was automatically evaluated. But we can assign our plot to an object, for example like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p &amp;lt;- ggplot(data = murders)
class(p)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;gg&amp;quot;     &amp;quot;ggplot&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To render the plot associated with this object, we simply print the object &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;. The following two lines of code each produce the same plot we see above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;print(p)
p&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;geometries-briefly&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Geometries (briefly)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt; we create graphs by adding geometry &lt;em&gt;layers&lt;/em&gt;. Layers can define geometries, compute summary statistics, define what scales to use, create annotations, or even change styles. To add layers, we use the symbol &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;. In general, a line of code will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;DATA %&amp;gt;% ggplot() + LAYER 1 + LAYER 2 + ... + LAYER N&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, the first &lt;strong&gt;added&lt;/strong&gt; layer after &lt;code&gt;ggplot() +&lt;/code&gt; defines the geometry. After that, we may add additional geometries, we may rescale an axis, we may add annotations and labels, or we may change the style. For now, we want to make a scatterplot. What geometry do we use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a quick look at the cheat sheet, we see that the function used to create plots with this geometry is &lt;code&gt;geom_point&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;embed src=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/main/data-visualization.pdf&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--(Source: [RStudio](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf))--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geometry function names follow the pattern: &lt;code&gt;geom_X&lt;/code&gt; where X is the name of some specific geometry. Some examples include &lt;code&gt;geom_point&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;geom_bar&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;geom_histogram&lt;/code&gt;. You’ve already seen a few of these. We will start with a scatterplot created using &lt;code&gt;geom_point()&lt;/code&gt; for now, then circle back to more geometries after we cover aesthetic mappings, layers, and annotations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;code&gt;geom_point&lt;/code&gt; to run properly we need to provide data and an &lt;strong&gt;aesthetic mapping&lt;/strong&gt;. The simplest mapping for a scatter plot is to say we want one variable on the X-axis, and a different one on the Y-axis, so each point is an {X,Y} pair. That is an &lt;strong&gt;aesthetic mapping&lt;/strong&gt; because X and Y are &lt;strong&gt;aesthetics&lt;/strong&gt; in a &lt;code&gt;geom_point&lt;/code&gt; scatterplot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already connected the object &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;murders&lt;/code&gt; data table, and if we add the layer &lt;code&gt;geom_point&lt;/code&gt; it defaults to using this data. To find out what mappings are expected, we read the &lt;strong&gt;Aesthetics&lt;/strong&gt; section of the help file &lt;code&gt;?geom_point&lt;/code&gt; help file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; Aesthetics
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; geom_point understands the following aesthetics (required aesthetics are in bold):
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; **x**
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; **y**
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; alpha
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; colour
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; fill
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; group
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; shape
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; size
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; stroke&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and—although it does not show in bold above—we see that at least two arguments are required: &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;. You can’t have a &lt;code&gt;geom_point&lt;/code&gt; scatterplot unless you state what you want on the X and Y axes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;aesthetic-mappings&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aesthetic mappings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aesthetic mappings&lt;/strong&gt; describe how properties of the data connect with features of the graph, such as distance along an axis, size, or color. The &lt;code&gt;aes&lt;/code&gt; function connects data with what we see on the graph by defining aesthetic mappings and will be one of the functions you use most often when plotting. The outcome of the &lt;code&gt;aes&lt;/code&gt; function is often used as the argument of a geometry function. This example produces a scatterplot of population in millions (x-axis) versus total murders (y-axis):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;murders %&amp;gt;% ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of defining our plot from scratch, we can also add a layer to the &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; object that was defined above as &lt;code&gt;p &amp;lt;- ggplot(data = murders)&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/01-example_files/figure-html/ggplot-example-3-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scales and annotations like axis labels are defined by default when adding this layer (note the x-axis label is exactly what we wrote in the function call). Like &lt;strong&gt;dplyr&lt;/strong&gt; functions, &lt;code&gt;aes&lt;/code&gt; also uses the variable names from the object component: we can use &lt;code&gt;population&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;total&lt;/code&gt; without having to call them as &lt;code&gt;murders$population&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;murders$total&lt;/code&gt;. The behavior of recognizing the variables from the data component is quite specific to &lt;code&gt;aes&lt;/code&gt;. With most functions, if you try to access the values of &lt;code&gt;population&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;total&lt;/code&gt; outside of &lt;code&gt;aes&lt;/code&gt; you receive an error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that we did some rescaling within the &lt;code&gt;aes()&lt;/code&gt; call - we can do simple things like multiplication or division on the variable names in the &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; call. The axis labels reflect this. We will change the axis labels later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;aesthetic mappings&lt;/strong&gt; are very powerful - changing the variable in &lt;code&gt;x=&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;y=&lt;/code&gt; changes the meaning of the plot entirely. We’ll come back to additional &lt;strong&gt;aesthetic mappings&lt;/strong&gt; once we talk about aesthetics in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;aesthetics-in-general&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Aesthetics in general&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even without mappings, a plots aesthetics can be useful. Things like color, fill, alpha, and size are aesthetics that can be changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we want larger points in our scatterplot. The &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic can be used to set the size. The scale of &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; is “multiples of the defaults” (so &lt;code&gt;size = 1&lt;/code&gt; is the default)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total), size = 3)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/01-example_files/figure-html/ggplot-example-5-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a mapping so it is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;aes()&lt;/code&gt; part: whereas mappings use data from specific observations and need to be inside &lt;code&gt;aes()&lt;/code&gt;, operations we want to affect all the points the same way do not need to be included inside &lt;code&gt;aes&lt;/code&gt;. We’ll see what happens if &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; is inside &lt;code&gt;aes(size = xxx)&lt;/code&gt; in a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can change the &lt;code&gt;shape&lt;/code&gt; to one of the many different base-R options found &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/r-plot-pch-symbols-the-different-point-shapes-available-in-r&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total), size = 3, shape = 17)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/01-example_files/figure-html/ggplot-example-5shape-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also change the &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total), size = 4, shape = 23, fill = &amp;#39;#18453B&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/01-example_files/figure-html/ggplot-example-5b-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; can take a common name like &lt;code&gt;&#39;green&#39;&lt;/code&gt;, or can take a hex color like &lt;code&gt;&#39;#18453B&#39;&lt;/code&gt;, which is &lt;a href=&#34;https://brand.msu.edu/design-visual/index.html#color&#34;&gt;MSU Green according to MSU’s branding site&lt;/a&gt;. You can also find &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/0BxNHwJi1y4&#34;&gt;UM Maize&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ&#34;&gt;OSU Scarlet&lt;/a&gt; on respective branding pages, or google “XXX color hex.” We’ll learn how to build a color palatte later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;colour&lt;/code&gt;, same thing because &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; creators allow both spellings) is a little tricky with points - it changes the outline of the geometry rather than the fill color, but in &lt;code&gt;geom_point()&lt;/code&gt; most shapes are only the outline, including the default. This is more useful with, say, a barplot where the outline and the fill might be different colors. Still, shapes 21-25 have both &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total), size = 5, shape = 23, fill = &amp;#39;#18453B&amp;#39;, color = &amp;#39;white&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/01-example_files/figure-html/ggplot-example-5c-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;color = &#39;white&#39;&lt;/code&gt; makes the outline of the shape white, which you can see if you look closely in the areas where the shapes overlap. This only works with shapes 21-25, or any other geometry that has both an outline and a fill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;now-back-to-aesthetic-mappings&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Now, back to aesthetic mappings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve seen a few aesthetics (and know we can find more by looking at which aesthetics work with our geometry in the help file), let’s return to the power of aesthetic mappings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;aesthetic mapping&lt;/strong&gt; means we can vary an aesthetic (like fill or shape or size) according to some &lt;strong&gt;variable in our data&lt;/strong&gt;. This opens up a world of possibilities! Let’s try adding to our &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; aesthetics with a &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic (since points respond to &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; better than &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt;) that varies by &lt;code&gt;region&lt;/code&gt;, which is a column in our data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total, color = region), size = 3)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/01-example_files/figure-html/ggplot-example-color-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We include &lt;code&gt;color=region&lt;/code&gt; &lt;strong&gt;inside&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;code&gt;aes&lt;/code&gt; call, which tells R to find a variable called &lt;code&gt;region&lt;/code&gt; and change color based on that. R will choose a somewhat ghastly color palatte, and &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; unique value in the data for &lt;code&gt;region&lt;/code&gt; will get a different color if the variable is discrete. If the variable is a continuous value, then &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; will automatically make a color ramp. Thus, &lt;strong&gt;discrete&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;continuous&lt;/strong&gt; values for aesthetic mappings work differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see a useful example of a continuous aesthetic mapping to &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt;. In our data, we are making a scatterplot of population and total murders, which really just shows that states with higher populations have higher murders. What we really want is murders per capita (I think COVID taught us a lot about rates vs. levels like “cases” and “cases per 100,000 people”). We can create a variable of “murders per capita” on the fly. Since “murders per capita” is a very small number and hard to read, we’ll multiply by 100 so that we get “percent of population murdered per year”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^5, y = total, color = 100*total/population), size = 3)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/01-example_files/figure-html/ggplot-example-colfill-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the clear pattern of “more population means more murders” is still there, look at the outlier in light blue in the bottom left. With the color ramp, see how easy it is to see here that there is one location where murders per capita is quite high?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; is outside of &lt;code&gt;aes&lt;/code&gt; and is set to an explicit value, not to a variable. What if we set size to a variable in the data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total, color = region, size = population/10^6))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/01-example_files/figure-html/ggplot-example-color2-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;legends-for-aesthetics&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Legends for aesthetics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see yet another useful default behavior: &lt;strong&gt;ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt; automatically adds a legend that maps color to region, and size to population (which we scaled by 1,000,000). To avoid adding this legend we set the &lt;code&gt;geom_point&lt;/code&gt; argument &lt;code&gt;show.legend = FALSE&lt;/code&gt;. This removes both the &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; legend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total, color = region, size = population/10^6), show.legend = FALSE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/01-example_files/figure-html/ggplot-example-color3-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, when we get to &lt;strong&gt;annotation layers&lt;/strong&gt;, we’ll talk about controlling the legend text and layout. For now, we just need to know how to turn them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;annotation-layers&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Annotation Layers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second layer in the plot we wish to make involves adding a label to each point to identify the state. The &lt;code&gt;geom_label&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;geom_text&lt;/code&gt; functions permit us to add text to the plot with and without a rectangle behind the text, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because each point (each state in this case) has a label, we need an &lt;strong&gt;aesthetic mapping&lt;/strong&gt; to make the connection between points and labels. By reading the help file &lt;code&gt;?geom_text&lt;/code&gt;, we learn that we supply the mapping between point and label through the &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt; argument of &lt;code&gt;aes&lt;/code&gt;. That is, &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt; is an &lt;strong&gt;aesthetic&lt;/strong&gt; that we can map. So the code looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total)) +
  geom_text(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total, label = abb))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/01-example_files/figure-html/ggplot-example-4-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have successfully added a second layer to the plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example of the unique behavior of &lt;code&gt;aes&lt;/code&gt; mentioned above, note that this call:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total)) + 
  geom_text(aes(population/10^6, total, label = abb))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is fine, whereas this call:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total)) + 
  geom_text(aes(population/10^6, total), label = abb)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will give you an error since &lt;code&gt;abb&lt;/code&gt; is not found because it is outside of the &lt;code&gt;aes&lt;/code&gt; function. The layer &lt;code&gt;geom_text&lt;/code&gt; does not know where to find &lt;code&gt;abb&lt;/code&gt; since it is a column name and not a global variable, and &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; does not look for column names for non-mapped aesthetics. For a trivial example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total)) +
  geom_text(aes(population/10^6, total), label = &amp;#39;abb&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/01-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;global-versus-local-aesthetic-mappings&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Global versus local aesthetic mappings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous line of code, we define the mapping &lt;code&gt;aes(population/10^6, total)&lt;/code&gt; twice, once in each geometry. We can avoid this by using a &lt;em&gt;global&lt;/em&gt; aesthetic mapping. We can do this when we define the blank slate &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; object. Remember that the function &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; contains an argument that permits us to define aesthetic mappings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;args(ggplot)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## function (data = NULL, mapping = aes(), ..., environment = parent.frame()) 
## NULL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we define a mapping in &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt;, all the geometries that are added as layers will default to this mapping. We redefine &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p &amp;lt;- murders %&amp;gt;% ggplot(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total, label = abb))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then we can simply write the following code to produce the previous plot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p + geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_text(nudge_x = 1.5) # offsets the label&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We keep the &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;nudge_x&lt;/code&gt; arguments in &lt;code&gt;geom_point&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;geom_text&lt;/code&gt;, respectively, because we want to only increase the size of points and only nudge the labels. If we put those arguments in &lt;code&gt;aes&lt;/code&gt; then they would apply to both plots. Also note that the &lt;code&gt;geom_point&lt;/code&gt; function does not need a &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt; argument and therefore ignores that aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If necessary, we can override the global mapping by defining a new mapping within each layer. These &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; definitions override the &lt;em&gt;global&lt;/em&gt;. Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p + geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(x = 10, y = 800, label = &amp;quot;Hello there!&amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/01-example_files/figure-html/ggplot-example-8-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the second call to &lt;code&gt;geom_text&lt;/code&gt; does not use &lt;code&gt;x = population&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y = total&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;try-it&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Try it!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;fyi&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s break in to smaller groups and try playing with some of the aesthetics and aesthetic mappings. If we’re online, we’ll use Zoom Breakout Rooms. Each of the rooms have a room number which will correspond with one of the tasks below. If we’re in person (woohoo!), we’ll form the same number of groups in class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each group, one person should be the main coder - someone who has the packages like &lt;code&gt;dslabs&lt;/code&gt; installed and has successfully run the plots above. Each set of tasks ask you to learn about an aesthetic and put it into action with the &lt;code&gt;murder&lt;/code&gt; data. We’ll leave about 5 minutes to do the task, then have you come back and share your results with the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each group, we’ll start with the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;p + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total)) +
  geom_text(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total, label = abb))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic mapping.
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: lower-alpha&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic can only take a number between 0 and 1. So first, in &lt;code&gt;murders&lt;/code&gt;, create a &lt;code&gt;murders_per_capita&lt;/code&gt; column by dividing &lt;code&gt;total&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;population&lt;/code&gt;. Second, find the &lt;code&gt;max(murders$murders_per_capita)&lt;/code&gt; and then create another new column called &lt;code&gt;murders_per_capita_rescaled&lt;/code&gt; which divides &lt;code&gt;murders_per_capita&lt;/code&gt; by the max value. &lt;code&gt;murders_per_capita_rescaled&lt;/code&gt; will be between 0 and 1, with the value of 1 for the state with the max murder rate. This is a little hard to do on the fly in &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic mapping to &lt;code&gt;murders_per_capita_rescaled&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;geom_point&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn off the legend using &lt;code&gt;show.legend=FALSE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include the &lt;code&gt;geom_text&lt;/code&gt; labels, but make sure the aesthetic mapping does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; apply to the labels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;nudge_x = 1.5&lt;/code&gt; as before to offset the labels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to explain the plot.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic help present the data here? It’s OK if it doesn’t!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;stroke&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic mapping.
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: lower-alpha&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;stroke&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic works a bit like the &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic. It must be used with a plot that has both a border and a fill, like shapes 21-25, so use one of those.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;code&gt;stroke&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic mapping (meaning the stroke will change according to a value in the data) to set a different stroke size based on murders &lt;em&gt;per capita&lt;/em&gt;. You can create a murders per capita variable on the fly, or add it to your &lt;code&gt;murders&lt;/code&gt; data.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include the text labels as before and use &lt;code&gt;nudge_x = 1.5&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you’re only setting the aesthetic for the points on the scatterplot!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;angle&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: lower-alpha&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;?geom_text&lt;/code&gt; help, note that &lt;code&gt;geom_text&lt;/code&gt; takes an aesthetic of &lt;code&gt;angle&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;code&gt;angle&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic (not aesthetic mapping) in the appropriate place (e.g. on &lt;code&gt;geom_text&lt;/code&gt; and not on other geometries) to adjust the labels on our plot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, try using the &lt;code&gt;angle&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic mapping by using the &lt;code&gt;total&lt;/code&gt; field as both the &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; value &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;code&gt;angle&lt;/code&gt; value in the &lt;code&gt;geom_text&lt;/code&gt; layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does using &lt;code&gt;angle&lt;/code&gt; as an aesthetic help? What about as an aesthetic mapping?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic mapping
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: lower-alpha&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic mapping in &lt;code&gt;geom_text&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;total/population&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;code&gt;nudge_x = 1.5&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic in &lt;code&gt;geom_text&lt;/code&gt; still&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try it with and without the legend using &lt;code&gt;show.legend&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to explain the plot.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic mapping help present the data here?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;geom_label&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: lower-alpha&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking at &lt;code&gt;?geom_label&lt;/code&gt; (which is the same help as &lt;code&gt;geom_text&lt;/code&gt;), we note that “The &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic controls the backgreound colour of the label”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic mapping to &lt;code&gt;total/population&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;geom_label&lt;/code&gt; (replacing &lt;code&gt;geom_text&lt;/code&gt; but still using &lt;code&gt;nudge_x=1.5&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic (not mapping) to the color of your choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to explain the plots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic mapping help present the data here?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What color did you choose for the non-mapped fill aesthetic?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;introduction-to-examples&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Introduction to Examples&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples in this class are designed to be presented in-class. Accordingly, the notes here are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; comprehensive. Instead, they are intended to guide students through&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also aware that my writing is dry and lifeless. If you’re reading this online without the advantage of seeing it in person, don’t worry—I’ll be “funnier” in class.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;getting-started&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting started with &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; and RStudio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; is not a programming language like &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Java&lt;/code&gt;. It was not created by software engineers for software development. Instead, it was developed by statisticians as an interactive environment for data analysis. You can read the full history in the paper A Brief History of S&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The interactivity is an indispensable feature in data science because, as you will soon learn, the ability to quickly explore data is a necessity for success in this field. However, like in other programming languages, you can save your work as scripts that can be easily executed at any moment. These scripts serve as a record of the analysis you performed, a key feature that facilitates reproducible work. If you are an expert programmer, you should not expect &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; to follow the conventions you are used—assuming this will leave you disappointed. If you are patient, you will come to appreciate the unequal power of &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; when it comes to data analysis and data visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other attractive features of &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; is free and open source&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It runs on all major platforms: Windows, Mac OS, UNIX/Linux.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scripts and data objects can be shared seamlessly across platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a large, growing, and active community of &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; users and, as a result, there are numerous resources for learning and asking questions&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#fn6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref6&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is easy for others to contribute add-ons which enables developers to share software implementations of new data science methodologies. The latest methods and tools are developed in &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; for a wide variety of disciplines and since social science is so broad, &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; is one of the few tools that spans the varied social sciences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-r-console&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; console&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interactive data analysis usually occurs on the &lt;em&gt;R console&lt;/em&gt; that executes commands as you type them. There are several ways to gain access to an &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; console. One way is to simply start &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; on your computer. The console looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/img/R_console2.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a quick example, try using the console to calculate a 15% tip on a meal that cost $19.71:&lt;a href=&#34;#fn7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref7&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;0.15 * 19.71  &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 2.9565&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note that in this course (at least, on most browsers), grey boxes are used to show &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; code typed into the &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; console. The symbol &lt;code&gt;##&lt;/code&gt; is used to denote what the &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; console outputs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;scripts&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scripts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the great advantages of &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; over point-and-click analysis software is that you can save your work as scripts. You can edit and save these scripts using a text editor. The material in this course was developed using the interactive &lt;em&gt;integrated development environment&lt;/em&gt; (IDE) RStudio&lt;a href=&#34;#fn8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref8&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. RStudio includes an editor with many &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; specific features, a console to execute your code, and other useful panes, including one to show figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/img/RStudio.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most web-based &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; consoles also provide a pane to edit scripts, but not all permit you to save the scripts for later use. On the upper-right part of this webpage you’ll see a little button with the &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; logo. You can access a web-based console there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;rstudio&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RStudio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RStudio will be our launching pad for data science projects. It not only provides an editor for us to create and edit our scripts but also provides many other useful tools. In this section, we go over some of the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-panes&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The panes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start RStudio for the first time, you will see three panes. The left pane shows the &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; console. On the right, the top pane includes tabs such as &lt;em&gt;Environment&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;History&lt;/em&gt;, while the bottom pane shows five tabs: &lt;em&gt;File&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Plots&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Packages&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Help&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Viewer&lt;/em&gt; (these tabs may change in new versions). You can click on each tab to move across the different features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start a new script, you can click on File, then New File, then &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; Script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This starts a new pane on the left and it is here where you can start writing your script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;key-bindings&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Key bindings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many tasks we perform with the mouse can be achieved with a combination of key strokes instead. These keyboard versions for performing tasks are referred to as &lt;em&gt;key bindings&lt;/em&gt;. For example, we just showed how to use the mouse to start a new script, but you can also use a key binding: Ctrl+Shift+N on Windows and command+shift+N on the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although in this tutorial we often show how to use the mouse, &lt;strong&gt;we highly recommend that you memorize key bindings for the operations you use most&lt;/strong&gt;. RStudio provides a useful cheat sheet with the most widely used commands. You might want to keep this handy so you can look up key-bindings when you find yourself performing repetitive point-and-clicking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;running-commands-while-editing-scripts&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Running commands while editing scripts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many editors specifically made for coding. These are useful because color and indentation are automatically added to make code more readable. RStudio is one of these editors, and it was specifically developed for R. One of the main advantages provided by RStudio over other editors is that we can test our code easily as we edit our scripts. Below we show an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by opening a new script as we did before. A next step is to give the script a name. We can do this through the editor by saving the current new unnamed script. To do this, click on the save icon or use the key binding Ctrl+S on Windows and command+S on the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you ask for the document to be saved for the first time, RStudio will prompt you for a name. A good convention is to use a descriptive name, with lower case letters, no spaces, only hyphens to separate words, and then followed by the suffix &lt;em&gt;.R&lt;/em&gt;. We will call this script &lt;em&gt;my-first-script.R&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we are ready to start editing our first script. The first lines of code in an &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; script are dedicated to loading the libraries we will use. Another useful RStudio feature is that once we type &lt;code&gt;library()&lt;/code&gt; it starts auto-completing with libraries that we have installed. Note what happens when we type &lt;code&gt;library(ti)&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another feature you may have noticed is that when you type &lt;code&gt;library(&lt;/code&gt; the second parenthesis is automatically added. This will help you avoid one of the most common errors in coding: forgetting to close a parenthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can continue to write code. As an example, we will make a graph showing murder totals versus population totals by state. Once you are done writing the code needed to make this plot, you can try it out by &lt;em&gt;executing&lt;/em&gt; the code. To do this, click on the &lt;em&gt;Run&lt;/em&gt; button on the upper right side of the editing pane. You can also use the key binding: Ctrl+Shift+Enter on Windows or command+shift+return on the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you run the code, you will see it appear in the &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; console and, in this case, the generated plot appears in the plots console. Note that the plot console has a useful interface that permits you to click back and forward across different plots, zoom in to the plot, or save the plots as files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run one line at a time instead of the entire script, you can use Control-Enter on Windows and command-return on the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;fyi&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SETUP TIP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change the option &lt;em&gt;Save workspace to .RData on exit&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Never&lt;/em&gt; and uncheck the &lt;em&gt;Restore .RData into workspace at start&lt;/em&gt;. By default, when you exit &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; saves all the objects you have created into a file called .RData. This is done so that when you restart the session in the same folder, it will load these objects. I find that this causes confusion especially when sharing code with colleagues or peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;installing-r-packages&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installing &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; packages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functionality provided by a fresh install of &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; is only a small fraction of what is possible. In fact, we refer to what you get after your first install as &lt;em&gt;base R&lt;/em&gt;. The extra functionality comes from add-ons available from developers. There are currently hundreds of these available from CRAN and many others shared via other repositories such as GitHub. However, because not everybody needs all available functionality, &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; instead makes different components available via &lt;em&gt;packages&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; makes it very easy to install packages from within R. For example, to install the &lt;strong&gt;dslabs&lt;/strong&gt; package, which we use to share datasets and code related to this book, you would type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;install.packages(&amp;quot;dslabs&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In RStudio, you can navigate to the &lt;em&gt;Tools&lt;/em&gt; tab and select install packages. We can then load the package into our &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; sessions using the &lt;code&gt;library&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(dslabs)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: package &amp;#39;dslabs&amp;#39; was built under R version 4.0.5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
## Attaching package: &amp;#39;dslabs&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## The following object is masked from &amp;#39;package:gapminder&amp;#39;:
## 
##     gapminder&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you go through this book, you will see that we load packages without installing them. This is because once you install a package, it remains installed and only needs to be loaded with &lt;code&gt;library&lt;/code&gt;. The package remains loaded until we quit the &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; session. If you try to load a package and get an error, it probably means you need to
install it first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can install more than one package at once by feeding a character vector to this function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;install.packages(c(&amp;quot;tidyverse&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;dslabs&amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One advantage of using RStudio is that it auto-completes package names once you start typing, which is helpful when you do not remember the exact spelling of the package. Once you select your package, we recommend selecting all the defaults. Note that installing &lt;strong&gt;tidyverse&lt;/strong&gt; actually installs several packages. This commonly occurs when a package has &lt;em&gt;dependencies&lt;/em&gt;, or uses functions from other packages. When you load a package using &lt;code&gt;library&lt;/code&gt;, you also load its dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once packages are installed, you can load them into &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; and you do not need to install them again, unless you install a fresh version of R. Remember packages are installed in &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; not RStudio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is helpful to keep a list of all the packages you need for your work in a script because if you need to perform a fresh install of R, you can re-install all your packages by simply running a script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see all the packages you have installed using the following function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;installed.packages()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we move through this course, we will constantly be adding to our toolbox of packages. Accordingly, you will need to keep track to ensure you have the requisite package for any given lecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;rmarkdown&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rmarkdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown is a general-purpose syntax for laying out documents. Rmarkdown is a combination of R and markdown, as the name implies. When using markdown, one can define headers and tables using specific notation, and depending on the rendering engine, the headers and tables (and a whole lot more) are customized. In fact, this whole website is built in R using Rmarkdown (and a lot of add-ons like Hugo and blogdown). In other contexts, the rendering engine may recognize that your headers are likely to be entries in a table of contents, and does so for you. The table of contents at the top of this document is built from the markdown headers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of Rmarkdown is that it lets us mix formatted text with R code. That is, you can have a section of the document that understands R code, and a separate section right after that discusses the results from the R code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajkirkpatrick/FS20/Spring2021/Rmarkdown_templates/SSC442_Weekly_Writing_Template.Rmd&#34;&gt;Try it out using the Weekly Writing Template&lt;/a&gt;. If it opens in your web browser, just right-click the link and select Save As…. &lt;strong&gt;Make sure you save the file to its own folder on your hard drive&lt;/strong&gt;. In converting your Rmarkdown .Rmd file to a .pdf, your system will make multiple interim files&lt;a href=&#34;#fn9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref9&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It also creates folders to store the output of any plots or graphics you create with your R code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have time today, let’s open the template linked above and see what happens when we select “knit to pdf”.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Illustrating Classification</title>
      <link>https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/10-example/</link>

      <description>
&lt;script src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/rmarkdown-libs/header-attrs/header-attrs.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;TOC&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#predicting-defaults&#34;&gt;Predicting Defaults&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;fyi&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s example will build on material in the “Content” tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;predicting-defaults&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Predicting Defaults&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we will continue to use the &lt;code&gt;ISLR&lt;/code&gt; data on defaults:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(ISLR)
library(tibble)
Default = ISLR::Default&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;fyi&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our first breakout:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clean the data so that the &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; column is a binary indicator for default&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build a logistic model to predict &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; using any combination of variables and interactions in the data. For now, just use your best judgement for choosing the variables and interactions – your lab for this week will have you formally tune a logistic model to optimize results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use a Bayes Classifier cutoff of .50 to generate your classifier output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in class, let’s look at how we did. What variables were most useful in explaining &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;fyi&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our second breakout, we will create a ROC curve manually. To do this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take your model from the first breakout, and using a loop (or &lt;code&gt;sapply&lt;/code&gt;), step through a large number of possible cutoffs for classification ranging from 0 to 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each cutoff, generate a confusion matrix with &lt;em&gt;accuracy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;sensitivity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;specificity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combine the cutoff with the &lt;em&gt;sensitivity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;specificity&lt;/em&gt; results and make a ROC plot. Use &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; for your plot and map the color aesthetic to the cutoff value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calculate the AUC (the &lt;em&gt;area under the curve&lt;/em&gt;). This is a little tricky but can be done with your data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Data Wrangling</title>
      <link>https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/11-example/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;div id=&#34;TOC&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#data-to-be-wrangled&#34;&gt;Data to be wrangled&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;data-to-be-wrangled&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Data to be wrangled&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You work for a travel booking website as a data analyst. A hotel has asked your company for data on corporate bookings at the hotel via your site. Specifically, they have five corporations that are frequent customers of the hotel, and they want to know who spends the most with them. They’ve asked you to help out. Most of the corporate spending is in the form of room reservations, but there are also parking fees that the hotel wants included in the analysis. Your goal: total up spending by corporation and report the biggest and smallest spenders inclusive of rooms and parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you only have the following data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/data/Example11_booking.csv&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;fas fa-file-csv&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;code&gt;booking.csv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Contains the corporation name, the room type, and the dates someone from the corporation stayed at the hoted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/data/Example11_roomrates.csv&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;fas fa-file-csv&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;code&gt;roomrates.csv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Contains the price of each room on each day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/data/Example11_parking.csv&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;fas fa-file-csv&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;code&gt;parking.csv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Contains the corporations who negotiated free parking for employees&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parking at the hotel is $60 if you don’t have free parking. This hotel is in California, so everyone drives and parks when they stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;fyi&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right-click on each of the links, copy the address, and read the URL in using &lt;code&gt;read.csv&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;read_csv&lt;/code&gt; or whatever you prefer to read .csv’s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll find you need to use most of the tools we covered on Tuesday including &lt;code&gt;gather&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;separate&lt;/code&gt; and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;A little more on Geospatial in R&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went over the basics and got some practice using geospatial data in R. Let’s look closely at the &lt;code&gt;tidycensus&lt;/code&gt; packages. Thus far, we have used &lt;code&gt;tigris&lt;/code&gt; to get TIGER/line census boundaries for things like counties. &lt;code&gt;tidycensus&lt;/code&gt; does more than this – we can pull actual census data with its geospatial references (the polygons referring to the counties, tracts, block groups, and blocks) &lt;em&gt;along with&lt;/em&gt; census data because &lt;code&gt;tidycensus&lt;/code&gt; interfaces with &lt;code&gt;tigris&lt;/code&gt; to combine the census data and the census geographies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;tigris-for-polygons&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tigris for polygons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you load &lt;code&gt;tigris&lt;/code&gt; (for spatial data) and &lt;code&gt;tidycensus&lt;/code&gt; for census data to attach to the spatial data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tigris)
library(tidycensus)
library(tidyverse)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already saw that we could extract counties using the &lt;code&gt;tigris::counties&lt;/code&gt; function. Some “census geographies” change from year to year. Counties don’t (usually), but census tracts, block groups, and blocks do. These last three are all nested units of observation - tracts hold multiple block groups, each block group holds multiple blocks. Blocks are pretty small, and a lot of census data isn’t reported at that level for confidentiality. Block groups don’t report all data, either. Tracts are usually the most reliable balance between “census data availability” and “small geographic area”. We’ll use the 2010 census boundaries by specifying &lt;code&gt;year = 2010&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at MI counties, then look at Ingham County census tracts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;MI.counties = tigris::counties(state=&amp;#39;MI&amp;#39;, year = 2010, progress_bar = FALSE)
ggplot(MI.counties, aes(fill = NAME10) ) +

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we get some counties that extend into the Great Lakes. That’s OK - we can use &lt;code&gt;st_intersect&lt;/code&gt; with a map of the Great Lakes to clean that up, but I won’t do that here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the census tracts for Ingham County. We can use &lt;code&gt;str_detect&lt;/code&gt; to find the County FIPS for Ingham:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ingham_FIPS = MI.counties %&amp;gt;%
  dplyr::filter(str_detect(NAME10, &amp;#39;Ingham&amp;#39;)) %&amp;gt;%
  dplyr::select(COUNTYFP, STATEFP) %&amp;gt;%
  pull(COUNTYFP)

Ingham.tracts = tigris::tracts(state=&amp;#39;MI&amp;#39;, county = Ingham_FIPS, year = 2010, progress_bar = FALSE)

print(Ingham.tracts %&amp;gt;% dplyr::select(TRACTCE10, NAME10, GEOID10))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the &lt;code&gt;GEOID10&lt;/code&gt; starts with the MI FIPS (26), the Ingham FIPS (065), then the 6 digits that make up the &lt;code&gt;TRACTCE10&lt;/code&gt; value. This is because tracts are nested in states and counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let’s show all the Ingham County tracts. I’ve changed the color mapping for the &lt;code&gt;col&lt;/code&gt; aesthetic so that the tract that holds MSU will be outlined in green:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(Ingham.tracts, aes(fill = TRACTCE10, col = (NAME10==&amp;#39;9800&amp;#39;))) +

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;tidycensus&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tidycensus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tidycensus takes some getting used to because census data is very complicated, has many geographies, and many subsets (e.g. you could be asking about the age of a specific combination of race and income). Here, we’re going to learn two things: how to find some basic census data by tract, and how to extract it with &lt;code&gt;tidycensus&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we can use the &lt;code&gt;tidyverse&lt;/code&gt; author’s “basic usage” page as a guide: &lt;a href=&#34;https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html&#34;&gt;https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;There are important directions for getting a Census API key, which must be added to your system&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;code&gt;tidycensus&lt;/code&gt; makes it easy - once you get your key (free from the US census, see the link for instructions), you just add it to your system using the &lt;code&gt;census_api_key&lt;/code&gt; function. You only have to do it once, it records the API key in your system files, and will find it automatically on subsequent projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;finding-variables&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Finding variables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually pretty tricky. The census asks many questions about demographics and other topics (house characteristics, earnings, health, etc.) and it can be hard to find exactly what you’re looking for. We’re going to seek some simple data: the average income, and the average “tenure” (how long someone has lived in their current residence) in each tract in Ingham County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tidycensus&lt;/code&gt; has some useful functions for finding variables, especially when combined with &lt;code&gt;str_detect&lt;/code&gt;, which helps us find certain words or phrases (our RegExp skills come in handy!) in the census variable names. Variables are identified by an ID, not by name. “P013001”, for instance, is the median age in a given geography. All variables are not available at all geographic units: “P013001” is available for all state, county, tract, and block group, but not block. The link above shows all of the geographies available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make things even more complicated, there is more than the decennial census. The American Community Survey (ACS) samples 1-5% of the population each year, and reports yearly but on a limited number of variables. We’ll use the ACS five-year (acs5) as it has more easily available data, even if it asks fewer questions. We’ll use the 2019 data, the most recently available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by finding all variables that contain “income”. Variable descriptions have the variable name as well as the “concept”. We want to use “concept” to search for our term. Each concept has multiple variables with it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;allvars = load_variables(2019, &amp;#39;acs5&amp;#39;)
incvars = allvars %&amp;gt;%
  dplyr::filter(str_detect(concept, &amp;#39;MEDIAN INCOME&amp;#39;))

incvars[1:5,]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 5 x 3
##   name       label                                                       concept
##   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;                                                       &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;  
## 1 B06011_001 Estimate!!Median income in the past 12 months --!!Total:    MEDIAN~
## 2 B06011_002 Estimate!!Median income in the past 12 months --!!Total:!!~ MEDIAN~
## 3 B06011_003 Estimate!!Median income in the past 12 months --!!Total:!!~ MEDIAN~
## 4 B06011_004 Estimate!!Median income in the past 12 months --!!Total:!!~ MEDIAN~
## 5 B06011_005 Estimate!!Median income in the past 12 months --!!Total:!!~ MEDIAN~&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got lucky - the first &lt;code&gt;concept&lt;/code&gt; is “MEDIAN INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (IN 2019 INFLATION-ADJUSTED DOLLARS) BY PLACE OF BIRTH”. Now, we didn’t want the “place of birth” part (though…sounds interesting), but look at the first &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt;. It is the &lt;code&gt;!!Total:&lt;/code&gt;, meaning it is the median income when you combine all places of birth. The second label is &lt;code&gt;!!Total:!!Born in state of residence&lt;/code&gt;, which is a &lt;em&gt;subset&lt;/em&gt; of the total. Same with the next. &lt;strong&gt;We do not need to use the subsets in order to use the &lt;code&gt;!!Total&lt;/code&gt; value&lt;/strong&gt;. Note the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;B06011_001&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots and lots of variables will have the same total - the next variable &lt;code&gt;B07011_001&lt;/code&gt; (after the Puerto Rico version) is the median income broken down by whether or not the household lives in the same house, instead of by place of birth. It’s long, but you can see that it is “MEDIAN INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (IN 2019 INFLATION-ADJUSTED DOLLARS) BY GEOGRAPHICAL MOBILITY IN THE PAST YEAR FOR CURRENT RESIDENCE IN THE UNITED STATES”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;incvars[6:15,]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 10 x 3

##  1 B06011PR_001 Estimate!!Median income in the past 12 months --!!Total: MEDIAN~
##  2 B06011PR_002 Estimate!!Median income in the past 12 months --!!Total~ MEDIAN~
##  3 B06011PR_003 Estimate!!Median income in the past 12 months --!!Total~ MEDIAN~
##  4 B06011PR_004 Estimate!!Median income in the past 12 months --!!Total~ MEDIAN~

##  9 B07011_004   Estimate!!Median income in the past 12 months --!!Total~ MEDIAN~
## 10 B07011_005   Estimate!!Median income in the past 12 months --!!Total~ MEDIAN~&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the values of the subsets will be different, the &lt;code&gt;!!Total:&lt;/code&gt; variable will be the same. So, we can really choose any &lt;code&gt;!!Total:&lt;/code&gt; variable for any set of variables in a &lt;code&gt;concept&lt;/code&gt; that fits our search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s call up the median income using &lt;code&gt;B06011_001&lt;/code&gt;. Note that we are naming our variables in the third line, and specifying that we only want &lt;code&gt;county = &#39;065&#39;&lt;/code&gt; for Ingham:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ing.medincome = get_acs(geography = &amp;#39;tract&amp;#39;,
                        county = &amp;#39;065&amp;#39;, state = &amp;#39;MI&amp;#39;,
                        variables = c(medincome = &amp;#39;B06011_001&amp;#39;),
                        year = 2019)
head(ing.medincome)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 6 x 5

## 1 26065000100 Census Tract 1, Ingham County, Michigan  medincome    22994  6149

&lt;p&gt;Since the ACS is a sample, the variable is returned as the &lt;code&gt;estimate&lt;/code&gt; along with a margin of error, which we’ll ignore for now. Note that the data is “tidy” - each row is one observation of one variable. If we have multiple variables, we can keep it tidy. We’ll compare the &lt;code&gt;B06011_001&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;B007011_001&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ing.medincome = get_acs(geography = &amp;#39;tract&amp;#39;,
                        county = &amp;#39;065&amp;#39;, state = &amp;#39;MI&amp;#39;,
                        variables = c(medincome = &amp;#39;B06011_001&amp;#39;,
                                      medincome2 = &amp;#39;B07011_001&amp;#39;), 
                        year = 2019) %&amp;gt;% arrange(GEOID)
head(ing.medincome)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 6 x 5
##   GEOID       NAME                                    variable   estimate   moe
##   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;       &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;                                   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;         &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
## 1 26065000100 Census Tract 1, Ingham County, Michigan medincome     22994  6149
## 2 26065000100 Census Tract 1, Ingham County, Michigan medincome2    22994  6149
## 3 26065000400 Census Tract 4, Ingham County, Michigan medincome     29059  4043

&lt;p&gt;We got to name the variables (useful!), and the results are “tidy” in that each observation-variable combination is a row. Clearly the two variable’s totals are the same, so we have convinced ourselves that &lt;code&gt;!!Total:&lt;/code&gt; works for any of the different concepts that cover median income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data is “tidy” but each variable is a row. Tidy data is this way because often, the data we wish to pull is a total, then each of the subcategories is a row. Imagine “race” by tract with counts of households by race. We don’t actually want the data this way if we want to map two different variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;tidycensus-and-geographies&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tidycensus and geographies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Let’s find the other variable we’re interested in - housing tenure. We’ll keep it simple and calculate the percentage of people in a tract who lived in the same house last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;tenvars = allvars %&amp;gt;%
  dplyr::filter(str_detect(concept, &amp;#39;TENURE&amp;#39;))

tenvars[1:5,]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 5 x 3
##   name       label                                                       concept
##   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;                                                       &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;  
## 1 B07013_001 Estimate!!Total:                                            GEOGRA~
## 2 B07013_002 Estimate!!Total:!!Householder lived in owner-occupied hous~ GEOGRA~
## 3 B07013_003 Estimate!!Total:!!Householder lived in renter-occupied hou~ GEOGRA~
## 4 B07013_004 Estimate!!Total:!!Same house 1 year ago:                    GEOGRA~
## 5 B07013_005 Estimate!!Total:!!Same house 1 year ago:!!Householder live~ GEOGRA~&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we get &lt;code&gt;B07013_001&lt;/code&gt;, which is the total number of households, and &lt;code&gt;B07014_004&lt;/code&gt;, which is the total number of households that lived in the same house a year ago. The ratio of these two tells us what percent didn’t move in the last year, which is what we want. We’re going to take the output in &lt;code&gt;wide&lt;/code&gt; format so that we can calculate this ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with variable numbers in hand, we can pretty easily get the attached geography of interest. We just add &lt;code&gt;geometry = TRUE&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;get_acs&lt;/code&gt; call. We’re also going to ask for &lt;code&gt;wide&lt;/code&gt; format, which gives us on row per tract and a column for each variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ing.tenure = get_acs(geography = &amp;#39;tract&amp;#39;,
                     county = &amp;#39;065&amp;#39;, state = &amp;#39;MI&amp;#39;,
                     variables = c(samehouse = &amp;#39;B07013_004&amp;#39;,
                                   totalhouse = &amp;#39;B07013_001&amp;#39;),
                     geometry = TRUE, output = &amp;#39;wide&amp;#39;, progress_bar = FALSE,
                     year = 2019)
ing.tenure&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get an “E” at the end of the variable which stands for “Estimate” (the “M” is “Margin of Error” since the ACS is a sample). We can now calculate the percent living in the same house they were in last year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ing.tenure = ing.tenure %&amp;gt;%
  dplyr::mutate(percentSameHouse = samehouseE/totalhouseE) %&amp;gt;%
  dplyr::select(GEOID, NAME, percentSameHouse)

ing.tenure&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NA’s come from tracts with zero households in them (the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wzzm13.com/article/news/local/michigan-life/seven-gables-road-haunted-michigan/69-e2f92018-59da-473c-ae32-1d7de68dd65e&#34;&gt;haunted&lt;/a&gt; Seven Gables Nature Area, GM’s Lansing plant, industrial areas, etc.). Let’s plot this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(ing.tenure, aes(fill = percentSameHouse)) +

&lt;h3&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding census variables via &lt;code&gt;tidycensus&lt;/code&gt; can be frustrating, and other sources exist to help lookup census tables. One useful tip is that you can use the “filter” button in your Rstudio &lt;code&gt;View()&lt;/code&gt; window to interactively filter the &lt;code&gt;concept&lt;/code&gt; column from &lt;code&gt;load_variables&lt;/code&gt;. Once you find what you want there, then use the &lt;code&gt;get_acs&lt;/code&gt; function in your code. Fundamentally, it’s a lot of information with the ability to subset in many way, which makes it hard to wade through and find what you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;fyi&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Load up all the necessary packages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose a new county and find the FIPS for that county&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose a variable you’re interested in. Finding census variables can be tricky!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;load_variables&lt;/code&gt;, find the best representation of that variable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make a map of that variable at the census tract level&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;fyi&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s example will pivot between the content from this week and the example below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also use the Ames data again (in addition to the Atlanta weather data). The Ames data is linked below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/projects/data/ames.csv&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;fas fa-file-csv&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;code&gt;Ames.csv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;preliminaries&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preliminaries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this example, we’re again going to use historical weather data from &lt;a href=&#34;https://darksky.net/forecast/33.7546,-84.39/us12/en&#34;&gt;Dark Sky&lt;/a&gt; about wind speed and temperature trends for downtown Atlanta (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/maps/place/33°45&amp;#39;16.4%22N+84°23&amp;#39;24.0%22W/@33.754557,-84.3921977,17z/&#34;&gt;specifically &lt;code&gt;33.754557, -84.390009&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) in 2019. We downloaded this data using Dark Sky’s (about-to-be-retired-because-they-were-bought-by-Apple) API using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hrbrmstr/darksky&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;darksky&lt;/strong&gt; package&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to follow along with this example, you can download the data below (you’ll likely need to right click and choose “Save Link As…”):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/data/atl-weather-2019.csv&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;fas fa-file-csv&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;code&gt;atl-weather-2019.csv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;code&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;load-and-clean-data&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Load and clean data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we load the libraries we’ll be using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tidyverse)  # For ggplot, dplyr, and friends
library(patchwork)  # For combining ggplot plots
library(GGally)     # For scatterplot matrices
library(broom)      # For converting model objects to data frames&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we load the data with &lt;code&gt;read_csv()&lt;/code&gt;. Here we assume that the CSV file lives in a subfolder named &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;weather_atl &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;quot;data/atl-weather-2019.csv&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;legal-dual-y-axes&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Legal dual y-axes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is fine (and often helpful) to use two y-axes if the two different scales measure the same thing, like counts and percentages, Fahrenheit and Celsius, pounds and kilograms, inches and centimeters, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, you need to add an argument (&lt;code&gt;sec.axis&lt;/code&gt;) to &lt;code&gt;scale_y_continuous()&lt;/code&gt; to tell it to use a second axis. This &lt;code&gt;sec.axis&lt;/code&gt; argument takes a &lt;code&gt;sec_axis()&lt;/code&gt; function that tells ggplot how to transform the scale. You need to specify a formula or function that defines how the original axis gets transformed. This formula uses a special syntax. It needs to start with a &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, which indicates that it’s a function, and it needs to use &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; to stand in for the original value in the original axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the equation for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius is this…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\text{C} = (32 - \text{F}) \times -\frac{5}{9}
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…we can specify this with code like so (where &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; stands for the Fahrenheit value):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;~ (32 - .) * -5 / 9&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a plot of daily high temperatures in Atlanta throughout 2019, with a second axis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = time, y = temperatureHigh)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(trans = ~ (32 - .) * -5/9,
                                         name = &amp;quot;Celsius&amp;quot;)) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = &amp;quot;Fahrenheit&amp;quot;) +
  theme_minimal()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/05-example_files/figure-html/atl-weather-dual-axes-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For fun, we could also convert it to Kelvin, which uses this formula:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\text{K} = (\text{F} - 32) \times \frac{5}{9} + 273.15
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = time, y = temperatureHigh)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(trans = ~ (. - 32) * 5/9 + 273.15,
                                         name = &amp;quot;Kelvin&amp;quot;)) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = &amp;quot;Fahrenheit&amp;quot;) +
  theme_minimal()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/05-example_files/figure-html/atl-weather-dual-axes-kelvin-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;combining-plots&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Combining plots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good alternative to using two y-axes is to use two plots instead. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/thomasp85/patchwork&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;patchwork&lt;/strong&gt; package&lt;/a&gt; makes this &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; easy to do with R. There are other similar packages that do this, like &lt;strong&gt;cowplot&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;gridExtra&lt;/strong&gt;, but I’ve found that &lt;strong&gt;patchwork&lt;/strong&gt; is the easiest to use &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; it actually aligns the different plot elements like axis lines and legends. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/articles/guides/assembly.html&#34;&gt;documentation for &lt;strong&gt;patchwork&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is really great and full of examples—you should check it out to see all the things you can do with it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use &lt;strong&gt;patchwork&lt;/strong&gt;, we need to (1) save our plots as objects and (2) add them together with &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, is there a relationship between temperature and humidity in Atlanta? We can plot both:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Temperature in Atlanta
temp_plot &amp;lt;- ggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = time, y = temperatureHigh)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(trans = ~ (32 - .) * -5/9,
                                         name = &amp;quot;Celsius&amp;quot;)) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = &amp;quot;Fahrenheit&amp;quot;) +
  theme_minimal()
temp_plot&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/05-example_files/figure-html/create-temp-humid-plots-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Humidity in Atlanta
humidity_plot &amp;lt;- ggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = time, y = humidity)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = &amp;quot;Humidity&amp;quot;) +
  theme_minimal()
humidity_plot&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/05-example_files/figure-html/create-temp-humid-plots-2.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, these are two separate plots, but we can combine them with &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; if we load &lt;strong&gt;patchwork&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(patchwork)

temp_plot + humidity_plot&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/05-example_files/figure-html/patchwork-first-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, &lt;strong&gt;patchwork&lt;/strong&gt; will put these side-by-side, but we can change that with the &lt;code&gt;plot_layout()&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;temp_plot + humidity_plot +
  plot_layout(ncol = 1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/05-example_files/figure-html/patchwork-vertical-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also play with other arguments in &lt;code&gt;plot_layout()&lt;/code&gt;. If we want to make the temperature plot taller and shrink the humidity section, we can specify the proportions for the plot heights. Here, the temperature plot is 70% of the height and the humidity plot is 30%:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;temp_plot + humidity_plot +
  plot_layout(ncol = 1, heights = c(0.7, 0.3))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/05-example_files/figure-html/patchwork-vertical-resized-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;scatterplot-matrices&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scatterplot matrices&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can visualize the correlations between pairs of variables with the &lt;code&gt;ggpairs()&lt;/code&gt; function in the &lt;strong&gt;GGally&lt;/strong&gt; package. For instance, how correlated are high and low temperatures, humidity, wind speed, and the chance of precipitation? We first make a smaller dataset with just those columns, and then we feed that dataset into &lt;code&gt;ggpairs()&lt;/code&gt; to see all the correlation information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(GGally)

weather_correlations &amp;lt;- weather_atl %&amp;gt;%
  select(temperatureHigh, temperatureLow, humidity, windSpeed, precipProbability)

ggpairs(weather_correlations)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/05-example_files/figure-html/ggpairs-1.png&#34; width=&#34;864&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like high and low temperatures are extremely highly positively correlated (r = 0.92). Wind spped and temperature are moderately negatively correlated, with low temperatures having a stronger negative correlation (r = -0.45). There’s no correlation whatsoever between low temperatures and the precipitation probability (r = -0.03) or humidity and high temperatures (r = -0.03).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though &lt;code&gt;ggpairs()&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t use the standard &lt;code&gt;ggplot(...) + geom_whatever()&lt;/code&gt; syntax we’re familiar with, it does behind the scenes, so you can add regular ggplot layers to it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggpairs(weather_correlations) +
  labs(title = &amp;quot;Correlations!&amp;quot;) +
  theme_dark()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;fyi&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRY IT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make a ggpairs plot for some of the Ames data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Correlograms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scatterplot matrices typically include way too much information to be used in actual publications. I use them when doing my own analysis just to see how different variables are related, but I rarely polish them up for public consumption. In the readings for today, Claus Wilke showed a type of plot called a &lt;a href=&#34;https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/visualizing-associations.html#associations-correlograms&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;correlogram&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; more appropriate for publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are essentially heatmaps of the different correlation coefficients. To make these with ggplot, we need to do a little bit of extra data processing, mostly to reshape data into a long, tidy format that we can plot. Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we need to build a correlation matrix of the main variables we care about. Ordinarily the &lt;code&gt;cor()&lt;/code&gt; function in R takes two arguments—x and y—and it will return a single correlation value. If you feed a data frame into &lt;code&gt;cor()&lt;/code&gt; though, it’ll calculate the correlation between each pair of columns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Create a correlation matrix
things_to_correlate &amp;lt;- weather_atl %&amp;gt;%
  select(temperatureHigh, temperatureLow, humidity, windSpeed, precipProbability) %&amp;gt;%
  cor()

things_to_correlate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##                   temperatureHigh temperatureLow humidity windSpeed precipProbability
## temperatureHigh              1.00          0.920   -0.030    -0.377            -0.124
## temperatureLow               0.92          1.000    0.112    -0.450            -0.026
## humidity                    -0.03          0.112    1.000     0.011             0.722
## windSpeed                   -0.38         -0.450    0.011     1.000             0.196
## precipProbability           -0.12         -0.026    0.722     0.196             1.000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two halves of this matrix (split along the diagonal line) are identical, so we can remove the lower triangle with this code (which will set all the cells in the lower triangle to &lt;code&gt;NA&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Get rid of the lower triangle
things_to_correlate[lower.tri(things_to_correlate)] &amp;lt;- NA
things_to_correlate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##                   temperatureHigh temperatureLow humidity windSpeed precipProbability
## temperatureHigh                 1           0.92    -0.03    -0.377            -0.124
## temperatureLow                 NA           1.00     0.11    -0.450            -0.026
## humidity                       NA             NA     1.00     0.011             0.722
## windSpeed                      NA             NA       NA     1.000             0.196
## precipProbability              NA             NA       NA        NA             1.000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in order to plot this, the data needs to be in tidy (or long) format. Here we convert the &lt;code&gt;things_to_correlate&lt;/code&gt; matrix into a data frame, add a column for the row names, take all the columns and put them into a single column named &lt;code&gt;measure1&lt;/code&gt;, and take all the correlation numbers and put them in a column named &lt;code&gt;cor&lt;/code&gt; In the end, we make sure the measure variables are ordered by their order of appearance (otherwise they plot alphabetically and don’t make a triangle)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;things_to_correlate_long &amp;lt;- things_to_correlate %&amp;gt;%
  # Convert from a matrix to a data frame
  as.data.frame() %&amp;gt;%
  # Matrixes have column names that don&amp;#39;t get converted to columns when using
  # as.data.frame(), so this adds those names as a column
  rownames_to_column(&amp;quot;measure2&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  # Make this long. Take all the columns except measure2 and put their names in
  # a column named measure1 and their values in a column named cor
  pivot_longer(cols = -measure2,
               names_to = &amp;quot;measure1&amp;quot;,
               values_to = &amp;quot;cor&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  # Make a new column with the rounded version of the correlation value
  mutate(nice_cor = round(cor, 2)) %&amp;gt;%
  # Remove rows where the two measures are the same (like the correlation
  # between humidity and humidity)
  filter(measure2 != measure1) %&amp;gt;%
  # Get rid of the empty triangle
  filter(!is.na(cor)) %&amp;gt;%
  # Put these categories in order
  mutate(measure1 = fct_inorder(measure1),
         measure2 = fct_inorder(measure2))

things_to_correlate_long&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 10 x 4

&lt;p&gt;Phew. With the data all tidied like that, we can make a correlogram with a heatmap. We have manipulated the fill scale a little so that it’s diverging with three colors: a high value, a midpoint value, and a low value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(things_to_correlate_long,
       aes(x = measure2, y = measure1, fill = cor)) +
  geom_tile() +
  geom_text(aes(label = nice_cor)) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = &amp;quot;#E16462&amp;quot;, mid = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;, high = &amp;quot;#0D0887&amp;quot;,
                       limits = c(-1, 1)) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/05-example_files/figure-html/cor-heatmap-1.png&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of using a heatmap, we can also use points, which encode the correlation information both as color &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; as size. To do that, we just need to switch &lt;code&gt;geom_tile()&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;geom_point()&lt;/code&gt; and set the &lt;code&gt;size = cor&lt;/code&gt; mapping:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(things_to_correlate_long,
       aes(x = measure2, y = measure1, color = cor)) +
  # Size by the absolute value so that -0.7 and 0.7 are the same size
  geom_point(aes(size = abs(cor))) +
  scale_color_gradient2(low = &amp;quot;#E16462&amp;quot;, mid = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;, high = &amp;quot;#0D0887&amp;quot;,
                        limits = c(-1, 1)) +
  scale_size_area(max_size = 15, limits = c(-1, 1), guide = FALSE) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: It is deprecated to specify `guide = FALSE` to remove a guide. Please use `guide = &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;` instead.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;simple-regression&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Simple regression&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finally get to this week’s content. Although correlation is nice, we eventually may want to visualize regression. The lecture has shown us some very intuitive, straightforward ways to think about regression (aka, a line). Simple regression is easy to visualize, since you’re only working with an &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; and a &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y\)&lt;/span&gt;. For instance, what’s the relationship between humidity and high temperatures during the summer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s filter the data to only look at the summer. We also add a column to scale up the humidity value—right now it’s on a scale of 0-1 (for percentages), but when interpreting regression we talk about increases in whole units, so we’d talk about moving from 0% humidity to 100% humidity, which isn’t helpful, so instead we multiply everything by 100 so we can talk about moving from 50% humidity to 51% humidity. We also scale up a couple other variables that we’ll use in the larger model later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;weather_atl_summer &amp;lt;- weather_atl %&amp;gt;%
  filter(time &amp;gt;= &amp;quot;2019-05-01&amp;quot;, time &amp;lt;= &amp;quot;2019-09-30&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(humidity_scaled = humidity * 100,
         moonPhase_scaled = moonPhase * 100,
         precipProbability_scaled = precipProbability * 100,
         cloudCover_scaled = cloudCover * 100)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we can build a simple regression model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;model_simple &amp;lt;- lm(temperatureHigh ~ humidity_scaled,
                   data = weather_atl_summer)

tidy(model_simple, conf.int = TRUE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 2 x 7
##   term            estimate std.error statistic  p.value conf.low conf.high
##   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;              &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
## 1 (Intercept)      104.       2.35       44.3  1.88e-88   99.5     109.   
## 2 humidity_scaled   -0.241    0.0358     -6.74 3.21e-10   -0.312    -0.170&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can interpret these coefficients like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The intercept shows that the average temperature when there’s 0% humidity is 104°. There are no days with 0% humidity though, so we can ignore the intercept—it’s really just here so that we can draw the line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The coefficient for &lt;code&gt;humidity_scaled&lt;/code&gt; shows that a one percent increase in humidity is associated with a 0.241° decrease in temperature, on average.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visualizing this model is simple, since there are only two variables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(weather_atl_summer,
       aes(x = humidity_scaled, y = temperatureHigh)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = &amp;quot;lm&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/05-example_files/figure-html/plot-simple-model-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed, as humidity increases, temperatures decrease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;coefficient-plots&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coefficient plots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we use multiple variables in the model (and we will do this a lot going forward), it gets really hard to visualize the results since we’re working with multiple dimensions. Instead, we can use coefficient plots to see the individual coefficients in the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s build a more complex model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;model_complex &amp;lt;- lm(temperatureHigh ~ humidity_scaled + moonPhase_scaled +
                      precipProbability_scaled + windSpeed + pressure + cloudCover_scaled,
                    data = weather_atl_summer)
tidy(model_complex, conf.int = TRUE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 7 x 7
##   term                     estimate std.error statistic   p.value conf.low conf.high
##   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;                       &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
## 1 (Intercept)              262.      125.         2.09  0.0380    14.8      510.    
## 2 humidity_scaled           -0.111     0.0757    -1.47  0.143     -0.261      0.0381
## 3 moonPhase_scaled           0.0116    0.0126     0.917 0.360     -0.0134     0.0366
## 4 precipProbability_scaled   0.0356    0.0203     1.75  0.0820    -0.00458    0.0758
## 5 windSpeed                 -1.78      0.414     -4.29  0.0000326 -2.59      -0.958 
## 6 pressure                  -0.157     0.122     -1.28  0.203     -0.398      0.0854
## 7 cloudCover_scaled         -0.0952    0.0304    -3.14  0.00207   -0.155     -0.0352&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can interpret these coefficients like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holding everything else constant, a 1% increase in humidity is associated with a 0.11° decrease in the high temperature, on average, but the effect is not statistically significant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holding everything else constant, a 1% increase in moon visibility is associated with a 0.01° increase in the high temperature, on average, and the effect is not statistically significant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holding everything else constant, a 1% increase in the probability of precipitation is associated with a 0.04° increase in the high temperature, on average, and the effect is not statistically significant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holding everything else constant, a 1 mph increase in the wind speed is associated with a 1.8° decrease in the high temperature, on average, and the effect &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; statistically significant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holding everything else constant, a 1 unit increase in barometric pressure is associated with a 0.15° decrease in the high temperature, on average, and the effect is not statistically significant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holding everything else constant, a 1% increase in cloud cover is associated with a 0.01° decrease in the high temperature, on average, and the effect &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; statistically significant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The intercept is pretty useless. It shows that the predicted temperature will be 262° when humidity is 0%, the moon is invisible, there’s no chance of precipitation, no wind, no barometric pressure, and no cloud cover. Yikes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To plot all these things at once, we’ll store the results of &lt;code&gt;tidy(model_complex)&lt;/code&gt; as a data frame, remove the useless intercept, and plot it using &lt;code&gt;geom_pointrange()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;model_tidied &amp;lt;- tidy(model_complex, conf.int = TRUE) %&amp;gt;%
  filter(term != &amp;quot;(Intercept)&amp;quot;)

ggplot(model_tidied,
       aes(x = estimate, y = term)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = &amp;quot;red&amp;quot;, linetype = &amp;quot;dotted&amp;quot;) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(xmin = conf.low, xmax = conf.high)) +
  labs(x = &amp;quot;Coefficient estimate&amp;quot;, y = NULL) +
  theme_minimal()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/05-example_files/figure-html/coef-plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neat! Now we can see how big these different coefficients are and how close they are to zero. Wind speed has a big significant effect on temperature. The others are all very close to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;marginal-effects-plots&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Marginal effects plots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of just looking at the coefficients, we can also see the effect of moving different variables up and down like sliders and switches. Remember that regression coefficients allow us to build actual mathematical formulas that predict the value of Y. The coefficients from &lt;code&gt;model_compex&lt;/code&gt; yield the following big hairy ugly equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\text{High temperature}} =&amp;amp; 262 - 0.11 \times \text{humidity_scaled } \\
&amp;amp; + 0.01 \times \text{moonPhase_scaled } + 0.04 \times \text{precipProbability_scaled } \\
&amp;amp; - 1.78 \times \text{windSpeed} - 0.16 \times \text{pressure} - 0.095 \times \text{cloudCover_scaled}
\end{aligned}
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we plug in values for each of the explanatory variables, we can get the predicted value of high temperature, or &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{y}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;augment()&lt;/code&gt; function in the &lt;strong&gt;broom&lt;/strong&gt; library allows us to take a data frame of explanatory variable values, plug them into the model equation, and get predictions out. For example, let’s set each of the variables to some arbitrary values (50% for humidity, moon phase, chance of rain, and cloud cover; 1000 for pressure, and 1 MPH for wind speed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;newdata_example &amp;lt;- tibble(humidity_scaled = 50, moonPhase_scaled = 50,
                          precipProbability_scaled = 50, windSpeed = 1,
                          pressure = 1000, cloudCover_scaled = 50)
newdata_example&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 1 x 6
##   humidity_scaled moonPhase_scaled precipProbability_scaled windSpeed pressure cloudCover_scaled
##             &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;            &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;                    &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;             &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
## 1              50               50                       50         1     1000                50&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can plug these values into the model with &lt;code&gt;augment()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# I use select() here because augment() returns columns for all the explanatory
# variables, and the .fitted column with the predicted value is on the far right
# and gets cut off
augment(model_complex, newdata = newdata_example, se_fit=TRUE) %&amp;gt;%
  select(.fitted, .se.fit)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 1 x 2
##   .fitted .se.fit
##     &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
## 1    96.2    3.19&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these weather conditions, the predicted high temperature is 96.2°. Now you’re an armchair meteorologist!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can follow the same pattern to show how the predicted temperature changes as specific variables change across a whole range. Here, we create a data frame of possible wind speeds and keep all the other explanatory variables at their means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;newdata &amp;lt;- tibble(windSpeed = seq(0, 8, 0.5),
                  pressure = mean(weather_atl_summer$pressure),
                  precipProbability_scaled = mean(weather_atl_summer$precipProbability_scaled),
                  moonPhase_scaled = mean(weather_atl_summer$moonPhase_scaled),
                  humidity_scaled = mean(weather_atl_summer$humidity_scaled),
                  cloudCover_scaled = mean(weather_atl_summer$cloudCover_scaled))
newdata&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we feed this big data frame into &lt;code&gt;augment()&lt;/code&gt;, we can get the predicted high temperature for each row. We can also use the &lt;code&gt;.se.fit&lt;/code&gt; column to calculate the 95% confidence interval for each predicted value. We take the standard error, multiply it by -1.96 and 1.96 (or the quantile of the normal distribution at 2.5% and 97.5%), and add that value to the estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;predicted_values &amp;lt;- augment(model_complex, newdata = newdata, se_fit=TRUE) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(conf.low = .fitted + (-1.96 * .se.fit),
         conf.high = .fitted + (1.96 * .se.fit))

predicted_values %&amp;gt;%
  select(windSpeed, .fitted, .se.fit, conf.low, conf.high) %&amp;gt;%
  head()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 6 x 5

&lt;p&gt;Cool! Just looking at the data in the table, we can see that predicted temperature drops as windspeed increases. We can plot this to visualize the effect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(predicted_values, aes(x = windSpeed, y = .fitted)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high),
              fill = &amp;quot;#BF3984&amp;quot;, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(size = 1, color = &amp;quot;#BF3984&amp;quot;) +
  labs(x = &amp;quot;Wind speed (MPH)&amp;quot;, y = &amp;quot;Predicted high temperature (F)&amp;quot;) +
  theme_minimal()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/05-example_files/figure-html/mfx-plot-simple-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just manipulated one of the model coefficients and held everything else at its mean. We can manipulate multiple variables too and encode them all on the graph. For instance, what is the effect of windspeed &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; cloud cover on the temperature?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll follow the same process, but vary both &lt;code&gt;windSpeed&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cloudCover_scaled&lt;/code&gt;. Instead of using &lt;code&gt;tibble()&lt;/code&gt;, we use &lt;code&gt;exapnd_grid()&lt;/code&gt;, which creates every combination of the variables we specify. Instead of varying cloud cover by every possible value (like from 0 to 100), we’ll choose four possible cloud cover types: 0%, 33%, 66%, and 100%. Everything else will be at its mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;newdata_fancy &amp;lt;- expand_grid(windSpeed = seq(0, 8, 0.5),
                             pressure = mean(weather_atl_summer$pressure),
                             precipProbability_scaled = mean(weather_atl_summer$precipProbability_scaled),
                             moonPhase_scaled = mean(weather_atl_summer$moonPhase_scaled),
                             humidity_scaled = mean(weather_atl_summer$humidity_scaled),
                             cloudCover_scaled = c(0, 33, 66, 100))
newdata_fancy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice now that &lt;code&gt;windSpeed&lt;/code&gt; repeats four times (0, 0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0.5, etc.), since there are four possible &lt;code&gt;cloudCover_scaled&lt;/code&gt; values (0, 33, 66, 100).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can plot this now, just like before, with wind speed on the x-axis, the predicted temperature on the y-axis, and colored and faceted by cloud cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;predicted_values_fancy &amp;lt;- augment(model_complex, newdata = newdata_fancy, se_fit=TRUE) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(conf.low = .fitted + (-1.96 * .se.fit),
         conf.high = .fitted + (1.96 * .se.fit)) %&amp;gt;%
  # Make cloud cover a categorical variable
  mutate(cloudCover_scaled = factor(cloudCover_scaled))

ggplot(predicted_values_fancy, aes(x = windSpeed, y = .fitted)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high, fill = cloudCover_scaled),
              alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(color = cloudCover_scaled), size = 1) +
  labs(x = &amp;quot;Wind speed (MPH)&amp;quot;, y = &amp;quot;Predicted high temperature (F)&amp;quot;) +
  theme_minimal() +
  guides(fill = FALSE, color = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(vars(cloudCover_scaled), nrow = 1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; = FALSE)` is deprecated. Please use `guides(&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt; = &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;)` instead.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice. Temperatures go down slightly as cloud cover increases. If we wanted to improve the model, we’d add an interaction term between cloud cover and windspeed so that each line would have a different slope in addition to a different intercept, but that’s beyond the scope of this class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far in each of our analyses, we have only used numeric variables as predictors. We have also only used &lt;em&gt;additive models&lt;/em&gt;, meaning the effect any predictor had on the response was not dependent on the other predictors. In this chapter, we will remove both of these restrictions. We will fit models with categorical predictors, and use models that allow predictors to &lt;em&gt;interact&lt;/em&gt;. The mathematics of multiple regression will remain largely unchanging, however, we will pay close attention to interpretation, as well as some difference in &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this example and discussion, we will briefly use the built in dataset &lt;code&gt;mtcars&lt;/code&gt; before introducing the &lt;code&gt;autompg&lt;/code&gt; dataset. The reason to use these easy, straightforward datasets is that they make visualization of the &lt;strong&gt;entire dataset&lt;/strong&gt; trivially easy. Accordingly, the &lt;code&gt;mtcars&lt;/code&gt; dataset is small, so we’ll quickly take a look at the entire dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be interested in three of the variables: &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;hp&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;am&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt;: fuel efficiency, in miles per gallon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;hp&lt;/code&gt;: horsepower, in foot-pounds per second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;am&lt;/code&gt;: transmission. Automatic or manual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we often do, we will start by plotting the data. We are interested in &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; as the response variable, and &lt;code&gt;hp&lt;/code&gt; as a predictor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars, cex = 2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/06-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are also interested in the transmission type, we could also label the points accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars, col = am + 1, pch = am + 1, cex = 2)
legend(&amp;quot;topright&amp;quot;, c(&amp;quot;Automatic&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Manual&amp;quot;), col = c(1, 2), pch = c(1, 2))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/06-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now fit the SLR model&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \epsilon,
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;code&gt;hp&lt;/code&gt;. For notational brevity, we drop the index &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt; for observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mpg_hp_slr = lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then re-plot the data and add the fitted line to the plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars, col = am + 1, pch = am + 1, cex = 2)
abline(mpg_hp_slr, lwd = 3, col = &amp;quot;grey&amp;quot;)
legend(&amp;quot;topright&amp;quot;, c(&amp;quot;Automatic&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Manual&amp;quot;), col = c(1, 2), pch = c(1, 2))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/06-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should notice a pattern here. The red, manual observations largely fall above the line, while the black, automatic observations are mostly below the line. This means our model underestimates the fuel efficiency of manual transmissions, and overestimates the fuel efficiency of automatic transmissions. To correct for this, we will add a predictor to our model, namely, &lt;code&gt;am&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_2\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our new model is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \epsilon,
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y\)&lt;/span&gt; remain the same, but now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
x_2 =
  \begin{cases}
   1 &amp;amp; \text{manual transmission} \\
   0       &amp;amp; \text{automatic transmission}
  \end{cases}.
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, we call &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_2\)&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;strong&gt;dummy variable&lt;/strong&gt;. A dummy variable (also called an “indicator” variable) is somewhat unfortunately named, as it is in no way “dumb”. In fact, it is actually somewhat clever. A dummy variable is a numerical variable that is used in a regression analysis to “code” for a binary categorical variable. Let’s see how this works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, note that &lt;code&gt;am&lt;/code&gt; is already a dummy variable, since it uses the values &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; to represent automatic and manual transmissions. Often, a variable like &lt;code&gt;am&lt;/code&gt; would store the character values &lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; and we would either have to convert these to &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, or, as we will see later, &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; will take care of creating dummy variables for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to fit the above model, we do so like any other multiple regression model we have seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mpg_hp_add = lm(mpg ~ hp + am, data = mtcars)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly checking the output, we see that &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; has estimated the three &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta\)&lt;/span&gt; parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mpg_hp_add&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = mpg ~ hp + am, data = mtcars)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)           hp           am  
##    26.58491     -0.05889      5.27709&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_2\)&lt;/span&gt; can only take values &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, we can effectively write two different models, one for manual and one for automatic transmissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For automatic transmissions, that is &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_2 = 0\)&lt;/span&gt;, we have,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \epsilon.
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then for manual transmissions, that is &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_2 = 1\)&lt;/span&gt;, we have,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
Y = (\beta_0 + \beta_2) + \beta_1 x_1 + \epsilon.
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that these models share the same slope, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_1\)&lt;/span&gt;, but have different intercepts, differing by &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_2\)&lt;/span&gt;. So the change in &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; is the same for both models, but on average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; differs by &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_2\)&lt;/span&gt; between the two transmission types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll now calculate the estimated slope and intercept of these two models so that we can add them to a plot. Note that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{\beta}_0\)&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;code&gt;coef(mpg_hp_add)[1]&lt;/code&gt; = 26.5849137&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{\beta}_1\)&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;code&gt;coef(mpg_hp_add)[2]&lt;/code&gt; = -0.0588878&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{\beta}_2\)&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;code&gt;coef(mpg_hp_add)[3]&lt;/code&gt; = 5.2770853&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can then combine these to calculate the estimated slope and intercepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;int_auto = coef(mpg_hp_add)[1]
int_manu = coef(mpg_hp_add)[1] + coef(mpg_hp_add)[3]

slope_auto = coef(mpg_hp_add)[2]
slope_manu = coef(mpg_hp_add)[2]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re-plotting the data, we use these slopes and intercepts to add the “two” fitted models to the plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars, col = am + 1, pch = am + 1, cex = 2)
abline(int_auto, slope_auto, col = 1, lty = 1, lwd = 2) # add line for auto
abline(int_manu, slope_manu, col = 2, lty = 2, lwd = 2) # add line for manual
legend(&amp;quot;topright&amp;quot;, c(&amp;quot;Automatic&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Manual&amp;quot;), col = c(1, 2), pch = c(1, 2))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/06-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We notice right away that the points are no longer systematically incorrect. The red, manual observations vary about the red line in no particular pattern without underestimating the observations as before. The black, automatic points vary about the black line, also without an obvious pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but as a statistician, sometimes a picture is worth an entire analysis. The above picture makes it plainly obvious that &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_2\)&lt;/span&gt; is significant, but let’s verify mathematically. Essentially we would like to test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
H_0: \beta_2 = 0 \quad \text{vs} \quad H_1: \beta_2 \neq 0.
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is nothing new. Again, the math is the same as the multiple regression analyses we have seen before. We could perform either a &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(t\)&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(F\)&lt;/span&gt; test here. The only difference is a slight change in interpretation. We could think of this as testing a model with a single line (&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(H_0\)&lt;/span&gt;) against a model that allows two lines (&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(H_1\)&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To obtain the test statistic and p-value for the &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(t\)&lt;/span&gt;-test, we would use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;summary(mpg_hp_add)$coefficients[&amp;quot;am&amp;quot;,]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##     Estimate   Std. Error      t value     Pr(&amp;gt;|t|) 
## 5.277085e+00 1.079541e+00 4.888270e+00 3.460318e-05&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do the same for the &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(F\)&lt;/span&gt; test, we would use a call to &lt;code&gt;anova&lt;/code&gt;. One way of comparing the fit of models (which accounts for the fact that one model is more “flexible” than another) is to use &lt;code&gt;anova&lt;/code&gt;. The null hypothesis of the &lt;code&gt;anova&lt;/code&gt; is that the two models explain the same amount of variation in the dependent variable (&lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt;). If we reject the F-test in the &lt;code&gt;anova&lt;/code&gt; (if the p-value is small), then the more flexible model is actually explaining more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;anova(mpg_hp_slr, mpg_hp_add)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that these are indeed testing the same thing, as the p-values are exactly equal. (And the &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(F\)&lt;/span&gt; test statistic is the &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(t\)&lt;/span&gt; test statistic squared.) This is only the case for different models that differ only by one additional variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recapping some interpretations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{\beta}_0 = 26.5849137\)&lt;/span&gt; is the estimated average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; for a car with an automatic transmission and &lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;hp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_2 = 31.8619991\)&lt;/span&gt; is the estimated average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; for a car with a manual transmission and &lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;hp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{\beta}_2 = 5.2770853\)&lt;/span&gt; is the estimated &lt;strong&gt;difference&lt;/strong&gt; in average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; for cars with manual transmissions as compared to those with automatic transmission, for &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;hp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{\beta}_1 = -0.0588878\)&lt;/span&gt; is the estimated change in average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; for an increase in one &lt;code&gt;hp&lt;/code&gt;, for &lt;strong&gt;either&lt;/strong&gt; transmission types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should take special notice of those last two. In the model,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \epsilon,
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we see &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_1\)&lt;/span&gt; is the average change in &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y\)&lt;/span&gt; for an increase in &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;em&gt;no matter&lt;/em&gt; the value of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_2\)&lt;/span&gt;. Also, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_2\)&lt;/span&gt; is always the difference in the average of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y\)&lt;/span&gt; for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; value of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt;. These are two restrictions we won’t always want, so we need a way to specify a more flexible model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we restricted ourselves to a single numerical predictor &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt; and one dummy variable &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_2\)&lt;/span&gt;. However, the concept of a dummy variable can be used with larger multiple regression models. We only use a single numerical predictor here for ease of visualization since we can think of the “two lines” interpretation. But in general, we can think of a dummy variable as creating “two models,” one for each category of a binary categorical variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;interactions&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interactions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remove the “same slope” restriction, we will now discuss &lt;strong&gt;interactions&lt;/strong&gt;. To illustrate this concept, we will use the &lt;code&gt;autompg&lt;/code&gt; dataset with a few modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve removed cars with &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; cylinders , as well as created a new variable &lt;code&gt;domestic&lt;/code&gt; which indicates whether or not a car was built in the United States. Removing the &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; cylinders is simply for ease of demonstration later in the chapter and would not be done in practice. The new variable &lt;code&gt;domestic&lt;/code&gt; takes the value &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; if the car was built in the United States, and &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; otherwise, which we will refer to as “foreign.” (We are arbitrarily using the United States as the reference point here.) We have also made &lt;code&gt;cyl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; into factor variables, which we will discuss later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll now be concerned with three variables: &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;domestic&lt;/code&gt;. We will use &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; as the response. We can fit a model,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \epsilon,
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt;, the fuel efficiency in miles per gallon,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;, the displacement in cubic inches,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_2\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;code&gt;domestic&lt;/code&gt; as described above, which is a dummy variable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
x_2 =
  \begin{cases}
   1 &amp;amp; \text{Domestic} \\
   0 &amp;amp; \text{Foreign}
  \end{cases}
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will fit this model, extract the slope and intercept for the “two lines,” plot the data and add the lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mpg_disp_add = lm(mpg ~ disp + as.factor(domestic), data = autompg)

int_for = coef(mpg_disp_add)[1]
int_dom = coef(mpg_disp_add)[1] + coef(mpg_disp_add)[3]

slope_for = coef(mpg_disp_add)[2]
slope_dom = coef(mpg_disp_add)[2] #--&amp;gt; same slope!

ggplot(autompg, aes(x = disp, y = mpg, col = as.factor(domestic))) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(intercept = int_dom, 
              slope = slope_dom, col = &amp;#39;blue&amp;#39;) +
  geom_abline(intercept = int_for,
              slope = slope_for, col = &amp;#39;red&amp;#39;) +
  labs(color = &amp;#39;Origin&amp;#39;) +
  scale_color_manual(labels = c(&amp;#39;Foreign&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Domestic&amp;#39;), values = c(&amp;#39;red&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;blue&amp;#39;)) +
  theme_bw()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/06-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a model that allows for two &lt;em&gt;parallel&lt;/em&gt; lines, meaning the &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; can be different on average between foreign and domestic cars of the same engine displacement, but the change in average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; for an increase in displacement is the same for both. We can see this model isn’t doing very well here. The red line fits the red points fairly well, but the black line isn’t doing very well for the black points, it should clearly have a more negative slope. Essentially, we would like a model that allows for two different slopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following model,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_1 x_2 + \epsilon,
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_2\)&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y\)&lt;/span&gt; are the same as before, but we have added a new &lt;strong&gt;interaction&lt;/strong&gt; term &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_1 x_2\)&lt;/span&gt; which multiplies &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_2\)&lt;/span&gt;, so we also have an additional &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta\)&lt;/span&gt; parameter &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_3\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model essentially creates two slopes and two intercepts, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_2\)&lt;/span&gt; being the difference in intercepts and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_3\)&lt;/span&gt; being the difference in slopes. To see this, we will break down the model into the two “sub-models” for foreign and domestic cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For foreign cars, that is &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_2 = 0\)&lt;/span&gt;, we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \epsilon.
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For domestic cars, that is &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_2 = 1\)&lt;/span&gt;, we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
Y = (\beta_0 + \beta_2) + (\beta_1 + \beta_3) x_1 + \epsilon.
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two models have both different slopes and intercepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_0\)&lt;/span&gt; is the average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; for a foreign car with &lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_1\)&lt;/span&gt; is the change in average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; for an increase of one &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;, for &lt;strong&gt;foreign&lt;/strong&gt; cars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_0 + \beta_2\)&lt;/span&gt; is the average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; for a domestic car with &lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_1 + \beta_3\)&lt;/span&gt; is the change in average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; for an increase of one &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;, for &lt;strong&gt;domestic&lt;/strong&gt; cars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we fit this model in &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;? There are a number of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One method would be to simply create a new variable, then fit a model like any other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;autompg$x3 = autompg$disp * autompg$domestic # THIS CODE NOT RUN!
do_not_do_this = lm(mpg ~ disp + domestic + x3, data = autompg) # THIS CODE NOT RUN!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should only do this as a last resort. We greatly prefer not to have to modify our data simply to fit a model. Instead, we can tell &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; we would like to use the existing data with an interaction term, which it will create automatically when we use the &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mpg_disp_int = lm(mpg ~ disp + domestic + disp:domestic, data = autompg)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative method, which will fit the exact same model as above would be to use the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; operator. This method automatically creates the interaction term, as well as any “lower order terms,” which in this case are the first order terms for &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;domestic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mpg_disp_int2 = lm(mpg ~ disp * domestic, data = autompg)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can quickly verify that these are doing the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;coef(mpg_disp_int)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##   (Intercept)          disp      domestic disp:domestic 
##    46.0548423    -0.1569239   -12.5754714     0.1025184&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;coef(mpg_disp_int2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##   (Intercept)          disp      domestic disp:domestic 
##    46.0548423    -0.1569239   -12.5754714     0.1025184&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see that both the variables, and their coefficient estimates are indeed the same for both models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;summary(mpg_disp_int)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##

&lt;p&gt;We see that using &lt;code&gt;summary()&lt;/code&gt; gives the usual output for a multiple regression model. We pay close attention to the row for &lt;code&gt;disp:domestic&lt;/code&gt; which tests,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
H_0: \beta_3 = 0.
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, testing for &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_3 = 0\)&lt;/span&gt; is testing for two lines with parallel slopes versus two lines with possibly different slopes. The &lt;code&gt;disp:domestic&lt;/code&gt; line in the &lt;code&gt;summary()&lt;/code&gt; output uses a &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(t\)&lt;/span&gt;-test to perform the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;int_for = coef(mpg_disp_int)[1]
int_dom = coef(mpg_disp_int)[1] + coef(mpg_disp_int)[3]

slope_for = coef(mpg_disp_int)[2]
slope_dom = coef(mpg_disp_int)[2] + coef(mpg_disp_int)[4]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we again calculate the slope and intercepts for the two lines for use in plotting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(autompg, aes(x = disp, y = mpg, col = as.factor(domestic))) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(intercept = int_dom, 
              slope = slope_dom, col = &amp;#39;blue&amp;#39;) +
  geom_abline(intercept = int_for,
              slope = slope_for, col = &amp;#39;red&amp;#39;) +
  labs(color = &amp;#39;Origin&amp;#39;) +
  scale_color_manual(labels = c(&amp;#39;Foreign&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Domestic&amp;#39;), values = c(&amp;#39;red&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;blue&amp;#39;)) +
  theme_bw()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/06-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see that these lines fit the data much better, which matches the result of our tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far we have only seen interaction between a categorical variable (&lt;code&gt;domestic&lt;/code&gt;) and a numerical variable (&lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;). While this is easy to visualize, since it allows for different slopes for two lines, it is not the only type of interaction we can use in a model. We can also consider interactions between two numerical variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the model,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_1 x_2 + \epsilon,
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt;, the fuel efficiency in miles per gallon,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;, the displacement in cubic inches,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_2\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;code&gt;hp&lt;/code&gt;, the horsepower, in foot-pounds per second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; change based on &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt; in this model? We can rearrange some terms to see how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
Y = \beta_0 + (\beta_1 + \beta_3 x_2) x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \epsilon
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for a one unit increase in &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;), the mean of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y\)&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt;) increases &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_1 + \beta_3 x_2\)&lt;/span&gt;, which is a different value depending on the value of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_2\)&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;code&gt;hp&lt;/code&gt;)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we’re now working in three dimensions, this model can’t be easily justified via visualizations like the previous example. Instead, we will have to rely on a test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mpg_disp_add_hp = lm(mpg ~ disp + hp, data = autompg)
mpg_disp_int_hp = lm(mpg ~ disp * hp, data = autompg)
summary(mpg_disp_int_hp)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;summary()&lt;/code&gt; we focus on the row for &lt;code&gt;disp:hp&lt;/code&gt; which tests,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
H_0: \beta_3 = 0.
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we see a very low p-value so we reject the null (additive model) in favor of the interaction model.
We can take a closer look at the coefficients of our fitted interaction model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;coef(mpg_disp_int_hp)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##   (Intercept)          disp            hp       disp:hp 
## 52.4081997848 -0.1001737655 -0.2198199720  0.0005658269&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{\beta}_0 = 52.4081998\)&lt;/span&gt; is the estimated average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; for a car with 0 &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt; and 0 &lt;code&gt;hp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{\beta}_1 = -0.1001738\)&lt;/span&gt; is the estimated change in average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; for an increase in 1 &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;for a car with 0 &lt;code&gt;hp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{\beta}_2 = -0.21982\)&lt;/span&gt; is the estimated change in average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; for an increase in 1 &lt;code&gt;hp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;for a car with 0 &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{\beta}_3 = 5.658269\times 10^{-4}\)&lt;/span&gt; is an estimate of the modification to the change in average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; for an increase in &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;, for a car of a certain &lt;code&gt;hp&lt;/code&gt; (or vice versa).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last coefficient needs further explanation. Recall the rearrangement we made earlier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
Y = \beta_0 + (\beta_1 + \beta_3 x_2) x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \epsilon.
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, our estimate for &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_1 + \beta_3 x_2\)&lt;/span&gt;, is &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{\beta}_1 + \hat{\beta}_3 x_2\)&lt;/span&gt;, which in this case is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
-0.1001738 + 5.658269\times 10^{-4} x_2.
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This says that, for an increase of one &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt; we see an estimated change in average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(-0.1001738 + 5.658269\times 10^{-4} x_2\)&lt;/span&gt;. So how &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; are related, depends on the &lt;code&gt;hp&lt;/code&gt; of the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for a car with 50 &lt;code&gt;hp&lt;/code&gt;, the estimated change in average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; for an increase of one &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
-0.1001738 + 5.658269\times 10^{-4} \cdot 50 = -0.0718824
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for a car with 350 &lt;code&gt;hp&lt;/code&gt;, the estimated change in average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; for an increase of one &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
-0.1001738 + 5.658269\times 10^{-4} \cdot 350 = 0.0978657
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the sign changed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;factor-variables&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Factor Variables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far in this chapter, we have limited our use of categorical variables to binary categorical variables. Specifically, we have limited ourselves to dummy variables which take a value of &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; and represent a categorical variable numerically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will now discuss &lt;strong&gt;factor&lt;/strong&gt; variables, which is a special way that &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; deals with categorical variables. With factor variables, a human user can simply think about the categories of a variable, and &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; will take care of the necessary dummy variables without any 0/1 assignment being done by the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;is.factor(autompg$domestic)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] FALSE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier when we used the &lt;code&gt;domestic&lt;/code&gt; variable, it was &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a factor variable. It was simply a numerical variable that only took two possible values, &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; for domestic, and &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; for foreign. Let’s create a new variable &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; that stores the same information, but in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;autompg$origin[autompg$domestic == 1] = &amp;quot;domestic&amp;quot;
autompg$origin[autompg$domestic == 0] = &amp;quot;foreign&amp;quot;
head(autompg$origin)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;domestic&amp;quot; &amp;quot;domestic&amp;quot; &amp;quot;domestic&amp;quot; &amp;quot;domestic&amp;quot; &amp;quot;domestic&amp;quot; &amp;quot;domestic&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; variable stores &lt;code&gt;&#34;domestic&#34;&lt;/code&gt; for domestic cars and &lt;code&gt;&#34;foreign&#34;&lt;/code&gt; for foreign cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;is.factor(autompg$origin)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] FALSE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is simply a vector of character values. A vector of car models is a character variable in &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;. A vector of Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) is a character variable as well. But those don’t represent a short list of levels that might influence a response variable. We will want to &lt;strong&gt;coerce&lt;/strong&gt; this origin variable to be something more: a factor variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;autompg$origin = as.factor(autompg$origin)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when we check the structure of the &lt;code&gt;autompg&lt;/code&gt; dataset, we see that &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; is a factor variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;str(autompg)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## &amp;#39;data.frame&amp;#39;:    383 obs. of  10 variables:
##  $ mpg     : num  18 15 18 16 17 15 14 14 14 15 ...
##  $ cyl     : Factor w/ 3 levels &amp;quot;4&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;6&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;8&amp;quot;: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...
##  $ disp    : num  307 350 318 304 302 429 454 440 455 390 ...
##  $ hp      : num  130 165 150 150 140 198 220 215 225 190 ...
##  $ wt      : num  3504 3693 3436 3433 3449 ...
##  $ acc     : num  12 11.5 11 12 10.5 10 9 8.5 10 8.5 ...
##  $ year    : int  70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 ...
##  $ origin  : Factor w/ 2 levels &amp;quot;domestic&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;foreign&amp;quot;: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
##  $ name    : chr  &amp;quot;chevrolet chevelle malibu&amp;quot; &amp;quot;buick skylark 320&amp;quot; &amp;quot;plymouth satellite&amp;quot; &amp;quot;amc rebel sst&amp;quot; ...
##  $ domestic: num  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factor variables have &lt;strong&gt;levels&lt;/strong&gt; which are the possible values (categories) that the variable may take, in this case foreign or domestic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;levels(autompg$origin)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;domestic&amp;quot; &amp;quot;foreign&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that previously we have fit the model&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_1 x_2 + \epsilon,
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt;, the fuel efficiency in miles per gallon,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;, the displacement in cubic inches,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_2\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;code&gt;domestic&lt;/code&gt; a dummy variable where &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; indicates a domestic car.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(mod_dummy = lm(mpg ~ disp * domestic, data = autompg))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = mpg ~ disp * domestic, data = autompg)
## 
## Coefficients:
##   (Intercept)           disp       domestic  disp:domestic  
##       46.0548        -0.1569       -12.5755         0.1025&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here we see that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_2 = 46.0548423 + -12.5754714 = 33.4793709
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is the estimated average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; for a &lt;strong&gt;domestic&lt;/strong&gt; car with 0 &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s try to do the same, but using our new factor variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(mod_factor = lm(mpg ~ disp * origin, data = autompg))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = mpg ~ disp * origin, data = autompg)
## 
## Coefficients:
##        (Intercept)                disp       originforeign  disp:originforeign  
##           33.47937            -0.05441            12.57547            -0.10252&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that it doesn’t produce the same results. Right away we notice that the intercept is different, as is the the coefficient in front of &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;. We also notice that the remaining two coefficients are of the same magnitude as their respective counterparts using the domestic variable, but with a different sign. Why is this happening?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out, that by using a factor variable, &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; is automatically creating a dummy variable for us. However, it is not the dummy variable that we had originally used ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; is fitting the model&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_1 x_2 + \epsilon,
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt;, the fuel efficiency in miles per gallon,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;, the displacement in cubic inches,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_2\)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;is a dummy variable created by &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; It uses &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; to represent a &lt;strong&gt;foreign car&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\hat{\beta}_0 = 33.4793709
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is the estimated average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; for a &lt;strong&gt;domestic&lt;/strong&gt; car with 0 &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;, which is indeed the same as before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; created &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_2\)&lt;/span&gt;, the dummy variable, it used domestic cars as the &lt;strong&gt;reference&lt;/strong&gt; level, that is the default value of the factor variable. So when the dummy variable is &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, the model represents this reference level, which is domestic. (&lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; makes this choice because domestic comes before foreign alphabetically.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the two models have different estimated coefficients, but due to the different model representations, they are actually the same model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;factors-with-more-than-two-levels&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Factors with More Than Two Levels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s now consider a factor variable with more than two levels. In this dataset, &lt;code&gt;cyl&lt;/code&gt; is an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;is.factor(autompg$cyl)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] TRUE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;levels(autompg$cyl)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;4&amp;quot; &amp;quot;6&amp;quot; &amp;quot;8&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the &lt;code&gt;cyl&lt;/code&gt; variable has three possible levels: &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt;. You may wonder, why not simply use &lt;code&gt;cyl&lt;/code&gt; as a numerical variable? You certainly could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that would force the difference in average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; between &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; cylinders to be the same as the difference in average mpg between &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt; cylinders. That usually make senses for a continuous variable, but not for a discrete variable with so few possible values. In the case of this variable, there is no such thing as a 7-cylinder engine or a 6.23-cylinder engine in personal vehicles. For these reasons, we will simply consider &lt;code&gt;cyl&lt;/code&gt; to be categorical. This is a decision that will commonly need to be made with ordinal variables. Often, with a large number of categories, the decision to treat them as numerical variables is appropriate because, otherwise, a large number of dummy variables are then needed to represent these variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define three dummy variables related to the &lt;code&gt;cyl&lt;/code&gt; factor variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
v_1 =
  \begin{cases}
   1 &amp;amp; \text{4 cylinder} \\
   0       &amp;amp; \text{not 4 cylinder}
  \end{cases}
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
v_2 =
  \begin{cases}
   1 &amp;amp; \text{6 cylinder} \\
   0       &amp;amp; \text{not 6 cylinder}
  \end{cases}
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
v_3 =
  \begin{cases}
   1 &amp;amp; \text{8 cylinder} \\
   0       &amp;amp; \text{not 8 cylinder}
  \end{cases}
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s fit an additive model in &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;, using &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; as the response, and &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cyl&lt;/code&gt; as predictors. This should be a model that uses “three regression lines” to model &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt;, one for each of the possible &lt;code&gt;cyl&lt;/code&gt; levels. They will all have the same slope (since it is an additive model), but each will have its own intercept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(mpg_disp_add_cyl = lm(mpg ~ disp + cyl, data = autompg))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = mpg ~ disp + cyl, data = autompg)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)         disp         cyl6         cyl8  
##    34.99929     -0.05217     -3.63325     -2.03603&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is, what is the model that &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; has fit here? It has chosen to use the model&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 v_2 + \beta_3 v_3 + \epsilon,
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt;, the fuel efficiency in miles per gallon,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;, the displacement in cubic inches,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(v_2\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(v_3\)&lt;/span&gt; are the dummy variables define above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why doesn’t &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; use &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(v_1\)&lt;/span&gt;? Essentially because it doesn’t need to. To create three lines, it only needs two dummy variables since it is using a reference level, which in this case is a 4 cylinder car. The three “sub models” are then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 Cylinder: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 Cylinder: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y = (\beta_0 + \beta_2) + \beta_1 x + \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 Cylinder: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y = (\beta_0 + \beta_3) + \beta_1 x + \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that they all have the same slope. However, using the two dummy variables, we achieve the three intercepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_0\)&lt;/span&gt; is the average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; for a 4 cylinder car with 0 &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_0 + \beta_2\)&lt;/span&gt; is the average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; for a 6 cylinder car with 0 &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_0 + \beta_3\)&lt;/span&gt; is the average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; for a 8 cylinder car with 0 &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So because 4 cylinder is the reference level, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_0\)&lt;/span&gt; is specific to 4 cylinders, but &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_2\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_3\)&lt;/span&gt; are used to represent quantities relative to 4 cylinders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have done before, we can extract these intercepts and slopes for the three lines, and plot them accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;int_4cyl = coef(mpg_disp_add_cyl)[1]
int_6cyl = coef(mpg_disp_add_cyl)[1] + coef(mpg_disp_add_cyl)[3]
int_8cyl = coef(mpg_disp_add_cyl)[1] + coef(mpg_disp_add_cyl)[4]

slope_all_cyl = coef(mpg_disp_add_cyl)[2]

plot_colors = c(&amp;quot;Darkorange&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Darkgrey&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Dodgerblue&amp;quot;)
plot(mpg ~ disp, data = autompg, col = plot_colors[cyl], pch = as.numeric(cyl))
abline(int_4cyl, slope_all_cyl, col = plot_colors[1], lty = 1, lwd = 2)
abline(int_6cyl, slope_all_cyl, col = plot_colors[2], lty = 2, lwd = 2)

&lt;p&gt;On this plot, we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 Cylinder: orange dots, solid orange line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 Cylinder: grey dots, dashed grey line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 Cylinder: blue dots, dotted blue line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The odd result here is that we’re estimating that 8 cylinder cars have better fuel efficiency than 6 cylinder cars at &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; displacement! The dotted blue line is always above the dashed grey line. That doesn’t seem right. Maybe for very large displacement engines that could be true, but that seems wrong for medium to low displacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To attempt to fix this, we will try using an interaction model, that is, instead of simply three intercepts and one slope, we will allow for three slopes. Again, we’ll let &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; take the wheel, (no pun intended) then figure out what model it has applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(mpg_disp_int_cyl = lm(mpg ~ disp * cyl, data = autompg))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = mpg ~ disp * cyl, data = autompg)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)         disp         cyl6         cyl8    disp:cyl6    disp:cyl8  
##    43.59052     -0.13069    -13.20026    -20.85706      0.08299      0.10817&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# could also use mpg ~ disp + cyl + disp:cyl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; has again chosen to use 4 cylinder cars as the reference level, but this also now has an effect on the interaction terms. &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; has fit the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 v_2 + \beta_3 v_3 + \gamma_2 x v_2 + \gamma_3 x v_3 + \epsilon
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re using &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\gamma\)&lt;/span&gt; like a &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta\)&lt;/span&gt; parameter for simplicity, so that, for example &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_2\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\gamma_2\)&lt;/span&gt; are both associated with &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(v_2\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the three “sub models” are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 Cylinder: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 Cylinder: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y = (\beta_0 + \beta_2) + (\beta_1 + \gamma_2) x + \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 Cylinder: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y = (\beta_0 + \beta_3) + (\beta_1 + \gamma_3) x + \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interpreting some parameters and coefficients then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\((\beta_0 + \beta_2)\)&lt;/span&gt; is the average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; of a 6 cylinder car with 0 &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\((\hat{\beta}_1 + \hat{\gamma}_3) = -0.1306935 + 0.1081714 = -0.0225221\)&lt;/span&gt; is the estimated change in average &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; for an increase of one &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;, for an 8 cylinder car.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as we have seen before &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_2\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_3\)&lt;/span&gt; change the intercepts for 6 and 8 cylinder cars relative to the reference level of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_0\)&lt;/span&gt; for 4 cylinder cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, similarly &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\gamma_2\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\gamma_3\)&lt;/span&gt; change the slopes for 6 and 8 cylinder cars relative to the reference level of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_1\)&lt;/span&gt; for 4 cylinder cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, we extract the coefficients and plot the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;int_4cyl = coef(mpg_disp_int_cyl)[1]
int_6cyl = coef(mpg_disp_int_cyl)[1] + coef(mpg_disp_int_cyl)[3]
int_8cyl = coef(mpg_disp_int_cyl)[1] + coef(mpg_disp_int_cyl)[4]

slope_4cyl = coef(mpg_disp_int_cyl)[2]
slope_6cyl = coef(mpg_disp_int_cyl)[2] + coef(mpg_disp_int_cyl)[5]
slope_8cyl = coef(mpg_disp_int_cyl)[2] + coef(mpg_disp_int_cyl)[6]

plot_colors = c(&amp;quot;Darkorange&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Darkgrey&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Dodgerblue&amp;quot;)
plot(mpg ~ disp, data = autompg, col = plot_colors[cyl], pch = as.numeric(cyl))
abline(int_4cyl, slope_4cyl, col = plot_colors[1], lty = 1, lwd = 2)
abline(int_6cyl, slope_6cyl, col = plot_colors[2], lty = 2, lwd = 2)
abline(int_8cyl, slope_8cyl, col = plot_colors[3], lty = 3, lwd = 2)
legend(&amp;quot;topright&amp;quot;, c(&amp;quot;4 Cylinder&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;6 Cylinder&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;8 Cylinder&amp;quot;),
       col = plot_colors, lty = c(1, 2, 3), pch = c(1, 2, 3))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/06-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks much better! We can see that for medium displacement cars, 6 cylinder cars now perform better than 8 cylinder cars, which seems much more reasonable than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To completely justify the interaction model (i.e., a unique slope for each &lt;code&gt;cyl&lt;/code&gt; level) compared to the additive model (single slope), we can perform an &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(F\)&lt;/span&gt;-test. Notice first, that there is no &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(t\)&lt;/span&gt;-test that will be able to do this since the difference between the two models is not a single parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will test,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
H_0: \gamma_2 = \gamma_3 = 0
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which represents the parallel regression lines we saw before,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 v_2 + \beta_3 v_3 + \epsilon.
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this is a difference of two parameters, thus no &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(t\)&lt;/span&gt;-test will be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;anova(mpg_disp_add_cyl, mpg_disp_int_cyl)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As expected, we see a very low p-value, and thus reject the null. We prefer the interaction model over the additive model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recapping a bit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Null Model: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 v_2 + \beta_3 v_3 + \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of parameters: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(q = 4\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full Model: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 v_2 + \beta_3 v_3 + \gamma_2 x v_2 + \gamma_3 x v_3 + \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of parameters: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p = 6\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;length(coef(mpg_disp_int_cyl)) - length(coef(mpg_disp_add_cyl))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see there is a difference of two parameters, which is also displayed in the resulting ANOVA table from &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;. Notice that the following two values also appear on the ANOVA table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;nrow(autompg) - length(coef(mpg_disp_int_cyl))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 377&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;nrow(autompg) - length(coef(mpg_disp_add_cyl))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 379&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;parameterization&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parameterization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far we have been simply letting &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; decide how to create the dummy variables, and thus &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; has been deciding the parameterization of the models. To illustrate the ability to use alternative parameterizations, we will recreate the data, but directly creating the dummy variables ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;new_param_data = data.frame(
  y = autompg$mpg,
  x = autompg$disp,
  v1 = 1 * as.numeric(autompg$cyl == 4),
  v2 = 1 * as.numeric(autompg$cyl == 6),
  v3 = 1 * as.numeric(autompg$cyl == 8))

head(new_param_data, 20)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##     y   x v1 v2 v3
## 1  18 307  0  0  1
## 2  15 350  0  0  1
## 3  18 318  0  0  1
## 4  16 304  0  0  1
## 5  17 302  0  0  1
## 6  15 429  0  0  1
## 7  14 454  0  0  1
## 8  14 440  0  0  1
## 9  14 455  0  0  1
## 10 15 390  0  0  1
## 11 15 383  0  0  1
## 12 14 340  0  0  1
## 13 15 400  0  0  1
## 14 14 455  0  0  1
## 15 24 113  1  0  0
## 16 22 198  0  1  0
## 17 18 199  0  1  0
## 18 21 200  0  1  0
## 19 27  97  1  0  0
## 20 26  97  1  0  0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;, the displacement in cubic inches,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;v3&lt;/code&gt; are dummy variables as defined above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First let’s try to fit an additive model using &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as well as the three dummy variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;lm(y ~ x + v1 + v2 + v3, data = new_param_data)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = y ~ x + v1 + v2 + v3, data = new_param_data)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)            x           v1           v2           v3  
##    32.96326     -0.05217      2.03603     -1.59722           NA&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is happening here? Notice that &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; is essentially ignoring &lt;code&gt;v3&lt;/code&gt;, but why? Well, because &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; uses an intercept, it cannot also use &lt;code&gt;v3&lt;/code&gt;. This is because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\boldsymbol{1} = v_1 + v_2 + v_3
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which means that &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\boldsymbol{1}\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(v_1\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(v_2\)&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(v_3\)&lt;/span&gt; are linearly dependent. This would make the &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X^\top X\)&lt;/span&gt; matrix singular, but we need to be able to invert it to solve the normal equations and obtain &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{\beta}.\)&lt;/span&gt; With the intercept, &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; can make the necessary “three intercepts”. So, in this case &lt;code&gt;v3&lt;/code&gt; is the reference level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we remove the intercept, then we can directly obtain all “three intercepts” without a reference level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;lm(y ~ 0 + x + v1 + v2 + v3, data = new_param_data)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = y ~ 0 + x + v1 + v2 + v3, data = new_param_data)
## 
## Coefficients:
##        x        v1        v2        v3  
## -0.05217  34.99929  31.36604  32.96326&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we are fitting the model&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
Y = \mu_1 v_1 + \mu_2 v_2 + \mu_3 v_3 + \beta x +\epsilon.
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus we have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 Cylinder: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y = \mu_1 + \beta x + \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 Cylinder: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y = \mu_2 + \beta x + \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 Cylinder: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y = \mu_3 + \beta x + \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could also do something similar with the interaction model, and give each line an intercept and slope, without the need for a reference level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;lm(y ~ 0 + v1 + v2 + v3 + x:v1 + x:v2 + x:v3, data = new_param_data)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = y ~ 0 + v1 + v2 + v3 + x:v1 + x:v2 + x:v3, data = new_param_data)
## 
## Coefficients:
##       v1        v2        v3      v1:x      v2:x      v3:x  
## 43.59052  30.39026  22.73346  -0.13069  -0.04770  -0.02252&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
Y = \mu_1 v_1 + \mu_2 v_2 + \mu_3 v_3 + \beta_1 x v_1 + \beta_2 x v_2 + \beta_3 x v_3 +\epsilon
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 Cylinder: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y = \mu_1 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 Cylinder: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y = \mu_2 + \beta_2 x + \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 Cylinder: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y = \mu_3 + \beta_3 x + \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the original data, we have (at least) three equivalent ways to specify the interaction model with &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;lm(mpg ~ disp * cyl, data = autompg)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = mpg ~ disp * cyl, data = autompg)

&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;lm(mpg ~ 0 + cyl + disp : cyl, data = autompg)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##

##

##      cyl4       cyl6       cyl8  cyl4:disp  cyl6:disp  cyl8:disp  
##  43.59052   30.39026   22.73346   -0.13069   -0.04770   -0.02252&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;lm(mpg ~ 0 + disp + cyl + disp : cyl, data = autompg)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = mpg ~ 0 + disp + cyl + disp:cyl, data = autompg)
## 
## Coefficients:
##      disp       cyl4       cyl6       cyl8  disp:cyl6  disp:cyl8  
##  -0.13069   43.59052   30.39026   22.73346    0.08299    0.10817&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They all fit the same model, importantly each using six parameters, but the coefficients mean slightly different things in each. However, once they are interpreted as slopes and intercepts for the “three lines” they will have the same result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;?all.equal&lt;/code&gt; to learn about the &lt;code&gt;all.equal()&lt;/code&gt; function, and think about how the following code verifies that the residuals of the two models are the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;all.equal(fitted(lm(mpg ~ disp * cyl, data = autompg)),
          fitted(lm(mpg ~ 0 + cyl + disp : cyl, data = autompg)))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] TRUE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;building-larger-models&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building Larger Models&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have seen how to incorporate categorical predictors as well as interaction terms, we can start to build much larger, much more flexible models which can potentially fit data better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define a “big” model,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 + \beta_4 x_1 x_2 + \beta_5 x_1 x_3 + \beta_6 x_2 x_3 + \beta_7 x_1 x_2 x_3 + \epsilon.
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_2\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;code&gt;hp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_3\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;code&gt;domestic&lt;/code&gt;, which is a dummy variable we defined, where &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; is a domestic vehicle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing to note here, we have included a new term &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_1 x_2 x_3\)&lt;/span&gt; which is a three-way interaction. Interaction terms can be larger and larger, up to the number of predictors in the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are using the three-way interaction term, we also use all possible two-way interactions, as well as each of the first order (&lt;strong&gt;main effect&lt;/strong&gt;) terms. This is the concept of a &lt;strong&gt;hierarchy&lt;/strong&gt;. Any time a “higher-order” term is in a model, the related “lower-order” terms should also be included. Mathematically their inclusion or exclusion is sometimes irrelevant, but from an interpretation standpoint, it is best to follow the hierarchy rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s do some rearrangement to obtain a “coefficient” in front of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 + \beta_6 x_2 x_3 + (\beta_1 + \beta_4 x_2 + \beta_5 x_3 + \beta_7 x_2 x_3)x_1 + \epsilon.
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the “coefficient” in front of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
(\beta_1 + \beta_4 x_2 + \beta_5 x_3 + \beta_7 x_2 x_3).
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s discuss this “coefficient” to help us understand the idea of the &lt;em&gt;flexibility&lt;/em&gt; of a model. Recall that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_1\)&lt;/span&gt; is the coefficient for a first order term,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_4\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_5\)&lt;/span&gt; are coefficients for two-way interactions,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_7\)&lt;/span&gt; is the coefficient for the three-way interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the two and three way interactions were not in the model, the whole “coefficient” would simply be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\beta_1.
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, no matter the values of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_2\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_3\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_1\)&lt;/span&gt; would determine the relationship between &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;) and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y\)&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the addition of the two-way interactions, now the “coefficient” would be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
(\beta_1 + \beta_4 x_2 + \beta_5 x_3).
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, changing &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;) has a different effect on &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y\)&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt;), depending on the values of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_2\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_3\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, adding the three-way interaction gives the whole “coefficient”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
(\beta_1 + \beta_4 x_2 + \beta_5 x_3 + \beta_7 x_2 x_3)
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is even more flexible. Now changing &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt;) has a different effect on &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y\)&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt;), depending on the values of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_2\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_3\)&lt;/span&gt;, but in a more flexible way which we can see with some more rearrangement. Now the “coefficient” in front of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_3\)&lt;/span&gt; in this “coefficient” is dependent on &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_2\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
(\beta_1 + \beta_4 x_2 + (\beta_5 + \beta_7 x_2) x_3)
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is so flexible, it is becoming hard to interpret!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s fit this three-way interaction model in &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;big_model = lm(mpg ~ disp * hp * domestic, data = autompg)
summary(big_model)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do we actually need this large of a model? Let’s first test for the necessity of the three-way interaction term. That is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
H_0: \beta_7 = 0.
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full Model: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 + \beta_4 x_1 x_2 + \beta_5 x_1 x_3 + \beta_6 x_2 x_3 + \beta_7 x_1 x_2 x_3 + \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Null Model: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 + \beta_4 x_1 x_2 + \beta_5 x_1 x_3 + \beta_6 x_2 x_3 + \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fit the null model in &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;two_way_int_mod&lt;/code&gt;. Again, we check to see if the big model is any more explanatory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;two_way_int_mod = lm(mpg ~ disp * hp + disp * domestic + hp * domestic, data = autompg)
#two_way_int_mod = lm(mpg ~ (disp + hp + domestic) ^ 2, data = autompg)
anova(two_way_int_mod, big_model)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Analysis of Variance Table
## 
## Model 1: mpg ~ disp * hp + disp * domestic + hp * domestic
## Model 2: mpg ~ disp * hp * domestic
##   Res.Df    RSS Df Sum of Sq      F Pr(&amp;gt;F)
## 1    376 5673.2                           
## 2    375 5645.6  1    27.599 1.8332 0.1766&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see the p-value is somewhat large, so we would fail to reject. We prefer the smaller, less flexible, null model, without the three-way interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick note here: the full model does still “fit better.” Notice that it has a smaller RMSE than the null model, which means the full model makes smaller (squared) errors on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mean(resid(big_model) ^ 2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 14.74053&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mean(resid(two_way_int_mod) ^ 2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 14.81259&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is not much smaller. We could even say that, the difference is insignificant. This is an idea we will return to later in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have chosen the model without the three-way interaction, can we go further? Do we need the two-way interactions? Let’s test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
H_0: \beta_4 = \beta_5 = \beta_6 = 0.
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember we already chose &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta_7 = 0\)&lt;/span&gt;, so,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full Model: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 + \beta_4 x_1 x_2 + \beta_5 x_1 x_3 + \beta_6 x_2 x_3 + \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Null Model: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 + \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fit the null model in &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;additive_mod&lt;/code&gt;, then use &lt;code&gt;anova()&lt;/code&gt; to perform an &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(F\)&lt;/span&gt;-test as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;additive_mod = lm(mpg ~ disp + hp + domestic, data = autompg)
anova(additive_mod, two_way_int_mod)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Analysis of Variance Table

## Model 2: mpg ~ disp * hp + disp * domestic + hp * domestic

&lt;p&gt;Here the p-value is small, so we reject the null, and we prefer the full (alternative) model. Of the models we have considered, our final preference is for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 + \beta_4 x_1 x_2 + \beta_5 x_1 x_3 + \beta_6 x_2 x_3 + \epsilon.

&lt;div id=&#34;model-selection&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Model Selection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often when we are developing a linear regression model, part of our goal is to &lt;strong&gt;explain&lt;/strong&gt; a relationship. Now, we will ignore much of what we have learned and instead simply use regression as a tool to &lt;strong&gt;predict&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead of a model which explains relationships, we seek a model which minimizes errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/regression.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, note that a linear model is one of many methods used in regression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To discuss linear models in the context of prediction, we introduce the (very boring) &lt;code&gt;Advertising&lt;/code&gt; data that is discussed in the ISL text (see supplemental readings). It can be found at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.statlearning.com/s/Advertising.csv&#34;&gt;https://www.statlearning.com/s/Advertising.csv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Advertising&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 200 x 5
##     ...1    TV radio newspaper sales
##    &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
##  1     1 230.   37.8      69.2  22.1
##  2     2  44.5  39.3      45.1  10.4
##  3     3  17.2  45.9      69.3   9.3
##  4     4 152.   41.3      58.5  18.5
##  5     5 181.   10.8      58.4  12.9
##  6     6   8.7  48.9      75     7.2
##  7     7  57.5  32.8      23.5  11.8
##  8     8 120.   19.6      11.6  13.2
##  9     9   8.6   2.1       1     4.8
## 10    10 200.    2.6      21.2  10.6
## # ... with 190 more rows&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can take a look at the relationship between &lt;code&gt;sales&lt;/code&gt; and the three modes of advertising using the &lt;code&gt;patchwork&lt;/code&gt; package (or any number of other ways)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(patchwork)
tv = ggplot(Advertising, aes(x = TV, y = sales)) + geom_point() + theme_bw()
rad = ggplot(Advertising, aes(x = radio, y = sales)) + geom_point() + theme_bw()
news = ggplot(Advertising, aes(x = newspaper, y = sales)) + geom_point() + theme_bw()
tv + rad + news&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png&#34; width=&#34;960&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see a relationship between each of the advertising modes and sales, but we might want to know more. Specifically, we probably want to know something about the sales-maximizing combination of the three modes. For that, we’d need a good model of sales. But what does “good” mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;assesing-model-accuracy&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Assesing Model Accuracy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many metrics to assess the accuracy of a regression model. Most of these measure in some way the average error that the model makes. The metric that we will be most interested in is the root-mean-square error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\text{RMSE}(\hat{f}, \text{Data}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\displaystyle\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\left(y_i - \hat{f}(\bf{x}_i)\right)^2}
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While for the sake of comparing models, the choice between RMSE and MSE is arbitrary, we have a preference for RMSE, as it has the same units as the response variable. Also, notice that in the prediction context MSE refers to an average, whereas in an ANOVA context, the denominator for MSE may not be &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a linear model , the estimate of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{f}\)&lt;/span&gt;, is given by the fitted regression line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\hat{y}({\bf{x}_i}) = \hat{f}({\bf{x}_i})
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can write an &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; function that will be useful for performing this calculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rmse = function(actual, predicted) {
  sqrt(mean((actual - predicted) ^ 2))
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Model Complexity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from how well a model predicts, we will also be very interested in the complexity (flexibility) of a model. For now, we will only consider nested linear models for simplicity. Then in that case, the more predictors that a model has, the more complex the model. For the sake of assigning a numerical value to the complexity of a linear model, we will use the number of predictors, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We write a simple &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; function to extract this information from a model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;get_complexity = function(model) {
  length(coef(model)) - 1
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;test-train-split&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Test-Train Split&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an issue with fitting a model to all available data then using RMSE to determine how well the model predicts. It is essentially cheating! As a linear model becomes more complex, the RSS, thus RMSE, can never go up. It will only go down, or in very specific cases, stay the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would suggest that to predict well, we should use the largest possible model! However, in reality we have hard fit to a specific dataset, but as soon as we see new data, a large model may in fact predict poorly. This is called &lt;strong&gt;overfitting&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequently we will take a dataset of interest and split it in two. One part of the datasets will be used to fit (train) a model, which we will call the &lt;strong&gt;training&lt;/strong&gt; data. The remainder of the original data will be used to assess how well the model is predicting, which we will call the &lt;strong&gt;test&lt;/strong&gt; data. Test data should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; be used to train a model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that sometimes the terms &lt;em&gt;evaluation set&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;test set&lt;/em&gt; are used interchangeably. We will give somewhat specific definitions to these later. For now we will simply use a single test set for a training set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we use the &lt;code&gt;sample()&lt;/code&gt; function to obtain a random sample of the rows of the original data. We then use those row numbers (and remaining row numbers) to split the data accordingly. Notice we used the &lt;code&gt;set.seed()&lt;/code&gt; function to allow use to reproduce the same random split each time we perform this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;set.seed(9)
num_obs = nrow(Advertising)

train_index = sample(num_obs, size = trunc(0.50 * num_obs))
train_data = Advertising[train_index, ]
test_data = Advertising[-train_index, ]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will look at two measures that assess how well a model is predicting, the &lt;strong&gt;train RMSE&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;test RMSE&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\text{RMSE}_{\text{Train}} = \text{RMSE}(\hat{f}, \text{Train Data}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_{\text{Tr}}}\displaystyle\sum_{i \in \text{Train}}^{}\left(y_i - \hat{f}(\bf{x}_i)\right)^2}
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(n_{Tr}\)&lt;/span&gt; is the number of observations in the train set. Train RMSE will still always go down (or stay the same) as the complexity of a linear model increases. That means train RMSE will not be useful for comparing models, but checking that it decreases is a useful sanity check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\text{RMSE}_{\text{Test}} = \text{RMSE}(\hat{f}, \text{Test Data}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_{\text{Te}}}\displaystyle\sum_{i \in \text{Test}}^{}\left(y_i - \hat{f}(\bf{x}_i)\right)^2}
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(n_{Te}\)&lt;/span&gt; is the number of observations in the test set. Test RMSE uses the model fit to the training data, but evaluated on the unused test data. This is a measure of how well the fitted model will predict &lt;strong&gt;in general&lt;/strong&gt;, not simply how well it fits data used to train the model, as is the case with train RMSE. What happens to test RMSE as the size of the model increases? That is what we will investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will start with the simplest possible linear model, that is, a model with no predictors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fit_0 = lm(sales ~ 1, data = train_data)
get_complexity(fit_0)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# train RMSE
sqrt(mean((train_data$sales - predict(fit_0, train_data)) ^ 2))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 5.529258&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# test RMSE
sqrt(mean((test_data$sales - predict(fit_0, test_data)) ^ 2))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 4.914163&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous two operations obtain the train and test RMSE. Since these are operations we are about to use repeatedly, we should use the function that we happen to have already written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# train RMSE
rmse(actual = train_data$sales, predicted = predict(fit_0, train_data))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 5.529258&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# test RMSE
rmse(actual = test_data$sales, predicted = predict(fit_0, test_data))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 4.914163&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function can actually be improved for the inputs that we are using. We would like to obtain train and test RMSE for a fitted model, given a train or test dataset, and the appropriate response variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;get_rmse = function(model, data, response) {
  rmse(actual = subset(data, select = response, drop = TRUE),
       predicted = predict(model, data))
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using this function, our code becomes easier to read, and it is more obvious what task we are accomplishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;get_rmse(model = fit_0, data = train_data, response = &amp;quot;sales&amp;quot;) # train RMSE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 5.529258&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;get_rmse(model = fit_0, data = test_data, response = &amp;quot;sales&amp;quot;) # test RMSE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 4.914163&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;adding-flexibility-to-linear-models&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adding Flexibility to Linear Models&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each successive model we fit will be more and more flexible using both interactions and polynomial terms. We will see the training error decrease each time the model is made more flexible. We expect the test error to decrease a number of times, then eventually start going up, as a result of overfitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fit_1 = lm(sales ~ ., data = train_data)
get_complexity(fit_1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;choosing-a-model&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choosing a Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand the relationship between train RMSE, test RMSE, and model complexity, we summarize our results, as the above is somewhat cluttered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we recap the models that we have fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fit_1 = lm(sales ~ ., data = train_data)
fit_2 = lm(sales ~ radio * newspaper * TV, data = train_data)
fit_3 = lm(sales ~ radio * newspaper * TV + I(TV ^ 2), data = train_data)
fit_4 = lm(sales ~ radio * newspaper * TV +
           I(TV ^ 2) + I(radio ^ 2) + I(newspaper ^ 2), data = train_data)
fit_5 = lm(sales ~ radio * newspaper * TV +
           I(TV ^ 2) * I(radio ^ 2) * I(newspaper ^ 2), data = train_data)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we create a list of the models fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;model_list = list(fit_1, fit_2, fit_3, fit_4, fit_5)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then obtain train RMSE, test RMSE, and model complexity for each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;train_rmse = sapply(model_list, get_rmse, data = train_data, response = &amp;quot;sales&amp;quot;)
test_rmse = sapply(model_list, get_rmse, data = test_data, response = &amp;quot;sales&amp;quot;)
model_complexity = sapply(model_list, get_complexity)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then plot the results. The train RMSE can be seen in blue, while the test RMSE is given in orange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(model_complexity, train_rmse, type = &amp;quot;b&amp;quot;,
     ylim = c(min(c(train_rmse, test_rmse)) - 0.02,
              max(c(train_rmse, test_rmse)) + 0.02),
     col = &amp;quot;dodgerblue&amp;quot;,
     xlab = &amp;quot;Model Size&amp;quot;,
     ylab = &amp;quot;RMSE&amp;quot;)
lines(model_complexity, test_rmse, type = &amp;quot;b&amp;quot;, col = &amp;quot;darkorange&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also summarize the results as a table. &lt;code&gt;fit_1&lt;/code&gt; is the least flexible, and &lt;code&gt;fit_5&lt;/code&gt; is the most flexible. We see the Train RMSE decrease as flexibility increases. We see that the Test RMSE is smallest for &lt;code&gt;fit_3&lt;/code&gt;, thus is the model we believe will perform the best on future data not used to train the model. Note this may not be the best model, but it is the best model of the models we have seen in this example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Model&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Train RMSE&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Test RMSE&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Predictors&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;fit_1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.8865831&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.4655147&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;fit_2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.0168223&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.9117228&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;fit_3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.6553091&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.6633375&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;fit_4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.6421909&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.7465957&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;fit_5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.6120887&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.7864181&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Underfitting models:&lt;/strong&gt; In general &lt;em&gt;High&lt;/em&gt; Train RMSE, &lt;em&gt;High&lt;/em&gt; Test RMSE. Seen in &lt;code&gt;fit_1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fit_2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overfitting models:&lt;/strong&gt; In general &lt;em&gt;Low&lt;/em&gt; Train RMSE, &lt;em&gt;High&lt;/em&gt; Test RMSE. Seen in &lt;code&gt;fit_4&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fit_5&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we say that a model is overfitting if there exists a less complex model with lower Test RMSE. Then a model is underfitting if there exists a more complex model with lower Test RMSE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of notes on these results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The labels of under and overfitting are &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt; to the best model we see, &lt;code&gt;fit_3&lt;/code&gt;. Any model more complex with higher Test RMSE is overfitting. Any model less complex with higher Test RMSE is underfitting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The train RMSE is guaranteed to follow this non-increasing pattern. The same is not true of test RMSE. Here we see a nice U-shaped curve. There are theoretical reasons why we should expect this, but that is on average. Because of the randomness of one test-train split, we may not always see this result. Re-perform this analysis with a different seed value and the pattern may not hold. We will discuss why we expect this next chapter. We will discuss how we can help create this U-shape much later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often we expect train RMSE to be lower than test RMSE. Again, due to the randomness of the split, you may get lucky and this will not be true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final note on the analysis performed here; we paid no attention whatsoever to the “assumptions” of a linear model. We only sought a model that &lt;strong&gt;predicted&lt;/strong&gt; well, and paid no attention to a model for &lt;strong&gt;explaination&lt;/strong&gt;. Hypothesis testing did not play a role in deciding the model, only prediction accuracy. Collinearity? We don’t care. Assumptions? Still don’t care. Diagnostics? Never heard of them. (These statements are a little over the top, and not completely true, but just to drive home the point that we only care about prediction. Often we latch onto methods that we have seen before, even when they are not needed.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our data and goal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to use the &lt;code&gt;wooldridge::wage2&lt;/code&gt; data on wages to generate and tune a non-parametric model of wages using a regression tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve learned that our RMSE calculations have a hard time with &lt;code&gt;NA&lt;/code&gt;s in the data. So let’s use the &lt;code&gt;skim&lt;/code&gt; output to drop variables with &lt;code&gt;NA&lt;/code&gt; (see &lt;code&gt;n_missing&lt;/code&gt;). Of course, there are other things we can do (impute the &lt;code&gt;NA&lt;/code&gt;s, or make dummies for them), but for now, it’s easiest to drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wage_clean = wage2 %&amp;gt;%
  dplyr::select(-brthord, -meduc, -feduc)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once cleaned, we should be able to use &lt;code&gt;rpart(wage ~ ., data = wage_clean)&lt;/code&gt; and not have any &lt;code&gt;NA&lt;/code&gt;s in our prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;some-functions&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Some functions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These functions are taken from our previous Content and Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rmse = function(actual, predicted) {
  sqrt(mean((actual - predicted) ^ 2))
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;get_rmse = function(model, data, response) {
  rmse(actual = subset(data, select = response, drop = TRUE),
       predicted = predict(model, data))
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;breakout-1&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Breakout #1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to assign you to breakout rooms to work in groups of 3-4 on live-coding. One person in the group will need to have Rstudio up, be able to share screen, and have the correct packages loaded (&lt;code&gt;caret&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rpart&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;rpart.plot&lt;/code&gt;, plus &lt;code&gt;skimr&lt;/code&gt;). Copy the &lt;code&gt;rmse&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;get_rmse&lt;/code&gt; code into a blank R script (you don’t have to use RMarkdown, just use a blank R script and run from there).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first breakout, all I want you to do is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimate a default regression tree on &lt;code&gt;wage_clean&lt;/code&gt; using the default parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;rpart.plot&lt;/code&gt; to vizualize your regression tree, and &lt;em&gt;talk through the interpretation&lt;/em&gt; with each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the RMSE for your regression tree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll bring you back in about 5 minutes. Remember, you can use &lt;code&gt;?wage2&lt;/code&gt; to see the variable names. Make sure you know what variables are showing up in the plot and explaining &lt;code&gt;wage&lt;/code&gt; in your model. You may find something odd at first and may need to drop more variables…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;breakout-1-discussion&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Breakout #1 discussion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s choose a group to share their plot and discuss the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;automating-models&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Automating models&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about a little code shortcut that helps iterate through your model selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, before, we used &lt;code&gt;list()&lt;/code&gt; to store all of our models. This is because &lt;code&gt;list()&lt;/code&gt; can “hold” anything at all, unlike a &lt;code&gt;matrix&lt;/code&gt;, which is only numeric, or a &lt;code&gt;data.frame&lt;/code&gt; which needs all rows in a column to be the same data type. &lt;code&gt;list()&lt;/code&gt; is also recursive, so each element in a list can be a list. Of lists. Of lists!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lists are also really easy to add to iteratively. We can initiate an empty list using &lt;code&gt;myList &amp;lt;- list()&lt;/code&gt;, then we can add things to it. Note that we use the double &lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt; to index:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;myList &amp;lt;- list()
myList[[&amp;#39;first&amp;#39;]] = &amp;#39;This is the first thing on my list&amp;#39;
print(myList)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## $first
## [1] &amp;quot;This is the first thing on my list&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lists let you name the “containers” (much like you can name colums in a &lt;code&gt;data.frame&lt;/code&gt;). Our first one is called “first”. We can add more later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;myList[[&amp;#39;second&amp;#39;]] = c(1,2,3)
print(myList)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## $first
## [1] &amp;quot;This is the first thing on my list&amp;quot;
## 
## $second
## [1] 1 2 3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And still more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;myList[[&amp;#39;third&amp;#39;]] = data.frame(a = c(1,2,3), b = c(&amp;#39;Albert&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Alex&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Alice&amp;#39;))
print(myList)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## $first
## [1] &amp;quot;This is the first thing on my list&amp;quot;
## 
## $second
## [1] 1 2 3
## 
## $third
##   a      b
## 1 1 Albert
## 2 2   Alex
## 3 3  Alice&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have a &lt;code&gt;data.frame&lt;/code&gt; in there! We can use &lt;code&gt;lapply&lt;/code&gt; to do something to every element in the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;lapply(myList, length) # the length() function with the first entry being the list element&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## $first
## [1] 1
## 
## $second
## [1] 3
## 
## $third
## [1] 2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get back a list of equal length but each (still-named) container is now the length of the original list’s contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;loops&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Loops&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R has a very useful looping function that takes the form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;for(i in c(&amp;#39;first&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;second&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;third&amp;#39;)){
print(i)
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;first&amp;quot;
## [1] &amp;quot;second&amp;quot;
## [1] &amp;quot;third&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, R is repeating the thing in the loop (&lt;code&gt;print(i)&lt;/code&gt;) with a different value for &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; each time. R repeats only what is &lt;em&gt;inside the curly-brackets&lt;/em&gt;, then when it reaches the close-curly-bracket, it goes back to the top, changes &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; to the next element, and repeats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use this to train our models. First, we clear our list object &lt;code&gt;myList&lt;/code&gt; by setting it equal to an empty list. Then, we loop over some regression tree tuning parameters. First, we have to figure out how to use the loop to set a &lt;em&gt;unique&lt;/em&gt; name for each list container. To do this, we’ll use &lt;code&gt;paste0(&#39;Tuning&#39;,i)&lt;/code&gt; which will result in a character string of &lt;code&gt;Tuning0&lt;/code&gt; when &lt;code&gt;i=0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Tuning0.01&lt;/code&gt; when &lt;code&gt;i=0.01&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;myList &amp;lt;- list()   # resets the list. Otherwise, you&amp;#39;ll just be adding to your old list!

for(i in c(0, 0.01, 0.02)){
  myList[[paste0(&amp;#39;Tuning&amp;#39;,i)]] = rpart(wage ~ ., data = wage_clean, cp = i)
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use &lt;code&gt;names(myList)&lt;/code&gt; you’ll see the result of our &lt;code&gt;paste0&lt;/code&gt; naming. If you want to see the plotted results, you can use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rpart.plot(myList[[&amp;#39;Tuning0.01&amp;#39;]])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/08-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;breakout-2&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Breakout #2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s send you back to your breakout rooms. Using the loop method, generate 5 regression trees to explain &lt;code&gt;wage&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;wage_clean&lt;/code&gt;. You can iterate through values of &lt;code&gt;cp&lt;/code&gt;, the complexity parameter, or &lt;code&gt;minsplit&lt;/code&gt;, the minimum # of points that have to be in each split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;breakout-2-discussion&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Breakout #2 discussion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;getting-rmse-from-the-list&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting RMSE from the list&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we want to move towards getting the RMSE for each of these trees. We’ve done this before using &lt;code&gt;lapply&lt;/code&gt;. Let’s introduce a neat coding shortcut, the &lt;code&gt;anonymous function&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;myRMSE &amp;lt;- lapply(myList, function(x){
                  get_rmse(x, wage_clean, &amp;#39;wage&amp;#39;)
                  } )

print(myRMSE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## $Tuning0
## [1] 292.5856
## 
## $Tuning0.01
## [1] 359.4592
## 
## $Tuning0.02
## [1] 367.2748&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it gets us the right answer, but whaaaaaat is going on? Curly brackets? &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an “anonymous function”, or a function created on the fly. Here’s how it works in &lt;code&gt;lapply&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first argument is the list you want to do something to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second argument would usually be the function you want to apply, like &lt;code&gt;get_rmse&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here, we’re going to ask R to &lt;em&gt;temporarily&lt;/em&gt; create a function that takes one argument, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is going to be each list element in &lt;code&gt;myList&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think of it as a loop:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take the first element of &lt;code&gt;myList&lt;/code&gt; and refer to it as &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. Run the function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then it’ll take the second element of &lt;code&gt;myList&lt;/code&gt; and refer to it as &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and run the function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat until all elements of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; have been used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the anonymous function has been applied to &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, the result is passed back and saved as the new element of the list output, always in the same position from where the &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; was taken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can think of it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;x = myList[[1]]
myList[[1]] = get_rmse(x, wage_clean, &amp;#39;wage&amp;#39;)

x = myList[[2]]
myList[[2]] = get_rmse(x, wage_clean, &amp;#39;wage&amp;#39;)

x = myList[[3]]
myList[[3]] = get_rmse(x, wage_clean, &amp;#39;wage&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can refer to &lt;code&gt;myList&lt;/code&gt; by name:
- &lt;code&gt;myList[[&#39;Tuning0.01&#39;]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you can refer to &lt;code&gt;myList&lt;/code&gt; by the index:
- &lt;code&gt;myList[[2]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like you can refer to &lt;code&gt;data.frame&lt;/code&gt; columns by name or by index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;breakout-3-if-time&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Breakout #3 (if time)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s send you to the breakout rooms one more time, and use &lt;code&gt;lapply&lt;/code&gt; to get a list of your RMSE’s (one for each of your models). Note that we are not yet splitting into &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;train&lt;/code&gt; (which you &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; need to do on your lab assignment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have your list, &lt;strong&gt;create the plot of RMSEs&lt;/strong&gt; similar to the one we looked at in Content this week. Note: you can use &lt;code&gt;unlist(myRMSE)&lt;/code&gt; to get a numeric vector of the RMSE’s (as long as all of the elements in &lt;code&gt;myRMSE&lt;/code&gt; are numeric). Then, it’s a matter of plotting either with base &lt;code&gt;plot&lt;/code&gt; or with &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; (if you use &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; you’ll have to &lt;code&gt;tidy&lt;/code&gt; the RMSE by adding the index column or naming the x-axis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;lecture-video&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lecture Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lecture video for Tuesday (this material, but we only made it about 2/3rds of the way) is &lt;a href=&#34;https://mediaspace.msu.edu/media/SSC442+-+Lecture+and+Office+Hours/1_l1untxni&#34;&gt;available here &lt;i class=&#34;fas fa-film&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;review-and-clarify&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Review and Clarify&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bias and Variance are tricky subjects. Hopefully the illustrations from yesterday are helpful. Let’s talk through a few things based on questions some of you have asked since Content 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;illustration-of-bias-vs.-variance&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Illustration of Bias vs. Variance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bias is about how close you are on average to the correct answer. Variance is about how scattered your estimates would be if you repeated your experiment with new data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:block;&#34; id=&#34;fig:unnamed-chunk-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.machinelearningplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/output_31_0.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image from MachineLearningPlus.com&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
Figure 1: Image from MachineLearningPlus.com
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We care about these things because we usually only have our one dataset (when we’re not creating simulated data, that is), but need to know something about how bias and variance tend to look when we change our model complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;deriving-bias-and-variance&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Deriving Bias and Variance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this section, recall our model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
y = f(x) + \epsilon
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tells us that some of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt; can be predicted by the &lt;strong&gt;true&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;, and some is just noise &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;. In our simulation from last week, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(f(x) = x^2\)&lt;/span&gt;, so &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y = x^2 + \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want to predict &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt;. We call our prediction &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{y}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our best guess for &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{f}(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{f}(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; is our model. It might be from a linear regression with 1, 2, 9, 15, etc. predictors or interactions of predictors. It might be from a k-nearest-neighbors estimation with &lt;code&gt;k = 4&lt;/code&gt;. It might be from a regression tree with &lt;code&gt;cp = .1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;minsplit=2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when we really nail &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{f}(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; (which means &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{f}(x) = f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;), there is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; error in our prediction because of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y \neq \hat{y}\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we think of two different measures of error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
EPE = E[(y - \hat{y})^2] = 
\underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}} \left[  \left(f(x) - \hat{f}(x) \right)^2 \right]}_\textrm{reducible error - MSE from imperfect model} +
\underbrace{\mathbb{V}_{Y \mid X} \left[ Y \mid X = x \right]}_{\textrm{irreducible error from }\epsilon}
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
MSE(f(x), \hat{f}(x)) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}\left[\left(f(x) - \hat{f}(x)\right)^2\right]
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you asked about this equation from last time that decomposed our MSE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\text{MSE}\left(f(x), \hat{f}(x)\right) =
\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}} \left[  \left(f(x) - \hat{f}(x) \right)^2 \right] =
\underbrace{\left(f(x) - \mathbb{E} \left[ \hat{f}(x) \right]  \right)^2}_{\text{bias}^2 \left(\hat{f}(x) \right)} +
\underbrace{\mathbb{E} \left[ \left( \hat{f}(x) - \mathbb{E} \left[ \hat{f}(x) \right] \right)^2 \right]}_{\text{var} \left(\hat{f}(x) \right)}
\]&lt;/span&gt;
This can be derived by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}} \left[  \left(f(x) - \hat{f}(x) \right)^2 \right] &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}} \left[\left(f(x) - E[\hat{f}(x)] + E[\hat{f}(x)] - \hat{f}(x)\right)^2 \right] \\
&amp;amp;=&amp;amp; \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}} \left[\left(f(x) - E[\hat{f}(x)]\right)^2 + \left(E[\hat{f}(x)] - \hat{f}(x)\right)^2 + 2\left(f(x) - E[\hat{f}(x)]\right) \left(E[\hat{f}(x)] - \hat{f}(x)\right) \right] \\
&amp;amp;=&amp;amp; \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}} \left[\left(f(x) - E[\hat{f}(x)]\right)^2\right] + \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}} \left[\left(E[\hat{f}(x)] - \hat{f}(x)\right)^2\right] +  \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}} \left[2\left(f(x) - E[\hat{f}(x)]\right) \left(E[\hat{f}(x)] - \hat{f}(x)\right) \right] \\
&amp;amp;=&amp;amp; \left(f(x) - E[\hat{f}(x)]\right)^2 + Var\left(\hat{f}(x)\right) + 0
\end{eqnarray*}
\]&lt;/span&gt;
Let’s talk about what’s in this equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MSE is the Mean Squared Error between &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{f}(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It does not have the &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt; in it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is an expectation over all the possible &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\mathcal{D}\)&lt;/span&gt; draws of the data we could have
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of this &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(E\left[\hat{f}(x)\right]\)&lt;/span&gt; can move out of the expectation. This lets us cancel that last term with the “2” in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main takeaway is that, even given the error, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;, we &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; have additional error coming from our inability to perfectly get &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{f}(x) = f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;a-quick-bit-of-r-code-to-help-with-todays-example&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A quick bit of R code to help with todays example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw before the usefulness of having a list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;myList = list()
myList[[&amp;#39;thisThing&amp;#39;]] = c(1,2,3)
myList[[&amp;#39;thisOtherThing&amp;#39;]] = c(&amp;#39;A&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;B&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;C&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;D&amp;#39;)
myList&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## $thisThing
## [1] 1 2 3
## 
## $thisOtherThing
## [1] &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; &amp;quot;D&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It worked really well for holding results from models since we could name the things in the list. But if we put it into a loop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;for(i in c(&amp;#39;G&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;H&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;)){
  myList = list()
  myList[[i]] = paste0(&amp;#39;This loop is on &amp;#39;,i)
}

print(myList)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## $I
## [1] &amp;quot;This loop is on I&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened? Every time we used the loop, it re-initiated the list, so we only get the last result!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what we want is to create the list &lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; it doesn’t exist, and add to it afterwards. We can do that with &lt;code&gt;exists(&#39;myList&#39;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;for(i in c(&amp;#39;G&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;H&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;)){
  if(!exists(&amp;#39;myList&amp;#39;)) myList = list()
  myList[[i]] = paste0(&amp;#39;This loop is on &amp;#39;,i)
}
print(myList)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## $I
## [1] &amp;quot;This loop is on I&amp;quot;
## 
## $G
## [1] &amp;quot;This loop is on G&amp;quot;
## 
## $H
## [1] &amp;quot;This loop is on H&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re almost there. It turns out, we have our original &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(I\)&lt;/span&gt; in there left over from the previous creation of the list. That’s why its out of order. What we want to do is start with a fresh, clean list. If we run &lt;code&gt;rm(myList)&lt;/code&gt;, the old list will no longer exist, and &lt;em&gt;our code will create a fresh one when we run it again!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rm(myList)
for(i in c(&amp;#39;G&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;H&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;)){
  if(!exists(&amp;#39;myList&amp;#39;)) myList = list()
  myList[[i]] = paste0(&amp;#39;This loop is on &amp;#39;,i)
}
print(myList)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## $G
## [1] &amp;quot;This loop is on G&amp;quot;
## 
## $H
## [1] &amp;quot;This loop is on H&amp;quot;
## 
## $I
## [1] &amp;quot;This loop is on I&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re going to use this in your breakout rooms today. You’re going to be asked to run some code that stores a plot in a list. To reset the list that stores things, just use &lt;code&gt;rm(listName)&lt;/code&gt; (where &lt;code&gt;listName&lt;/code&gt; is the name of the list).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can make sure you run code (outside of the loop) that makes a new list. This will re-set the list to be empty going into the loop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;myList = list()
for(i in c(&amp;#39;G&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;H&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;)){
  if(!exists(&amp;#39;myList&amp;#39;)) myList = list()
  myList[[i]] = paste0(&amp;#39;This loop is on &amp;#39;,i)
}
print(myList)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## $G
## [1] &amp;quot;This loop is on G&amp;quot;
## 
## $H
## [1] &amp;quot;This loop is on H&amp;quot;
## 
## $I
## [1] &amp;quot;This loop is on I&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;todays-example&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Today’s Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal today is to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the code that produced this week’s Content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why? Because it helps to illustrate the &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; sources of noise in the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;See what larger sample sizes and higher/lower irreducible error does to our Bias vs. Variance tradeoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;simulation&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Simulation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use the exact code from Content 9, which I have reproduced here. I have removed the in-between parts with notation so we can focus on the example. I have &lt;strong&gt;copied all of the relevant code into one chunk down at the bottom as well&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll need the following libraries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(tidyverse)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## -- Attaching packages --------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.3.1 --&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## v tibble  3.1.6     v dplyr   1.0.8
## v tidyr   1.2.0     v stringr 1.4.0
## v readr   2.1.2     v forcats 0.5.1
## v purrr   0.3.4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## -- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() --
## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here, I’ve made a little change to Content 9’s code so we can play with sample size &lt;code&gt;NN&lt;/code&gt; and the SD of the irreducible Bayes error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;NN = 100   #----&amp;gt; In class, we will change this to 
#                 see how our results change in response
SD.of.Bayes.Error = .75   #-----&amp;gt; This, too, will change. 

# Note that both of these are used in the next chunk(s) to generate data.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;begin-content-9-code-here&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Begin Content 9 code here:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will illustrate these decompositions, most importantly the bias-variance tradeoff, through simulation. Suppose we would like to train a model to learn the true regression function function &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(f(x) = x^2\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;f = function(x) {
  x ^ 2
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To carry out a concrete simulation example, we need to fully specify the data generating process. We do so with the following &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;get_sim_data = function(f, sample_size = NN) {
  x = runif(n = sample_size, min = 0, max = 1)
  eps = rnorm(n = sample_size, mean = 0, sd = SD.of.Bayes.Error)
  y = f(x) + eps
  tibble(x, y)
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To completely specify the data generating process, we have made more model assumptions than simply &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\mathbb{E}[Y \mid X = x] = x^2\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\mathbb{V}[Y \mid X = x] = \sigma ^ 2\)&lt;/span&gt;. In particular,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_i\)&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\mathcal{D}\)&lt;/span&gt; are sampled from a uniform distribution over &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\([0, 1]\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x_i\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt; are independent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y_i\)&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\mathcal{D}\)&lt;/span&gt; are sampled from the conditional normal distribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this setup, we will generate datasets, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\mathcal{D}\)&lt;/span&gt;, with a sample size &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(NN\)&lt;/span&gt; and fit four models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{predict(fit0, x)} &amp;amp;= \hat{f}_0(x) = \hat{\beta}_0\\
\texttt{predict(fit1, x)} &amp;amp;= \hat{f}_1(x) = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x \\
\texttt{predict(fit2, x)} &amp;amp;= \hat{f}_2(x) = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x + \hat{\beta}_2 x^2 \\
\texttt{predict(fit9, x)} &amp;amp;= \hat{f}_9(x) = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x + \hat{\beta}_2 x^2 + \ldots + \hat{\beta}_9 x^9
\end{aligned}
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a sense of the data and these four models, we generate one simulated dataset, and fit the four models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;set.seed(1)
sim_data = get_sim_data(f)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fit_0 = lm(y ~ 1,                   data = sim_data)
fit_1 = lm(y ~ poly(x, degree = 1), data = sim_data)
fit_2 = lm(y ~ poly(x, degree = 2), data = sim_data)
fit_9 = lm(y ~ poly(x, degree = 9), data = sim_data)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plotting these four trained models, we see that the zero predictor model does very poorly. The first degree model is reasonable, but we can see that the second degree model fits much better. The ninth degree model seem rather wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/09-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png&#34; width=&#34;864&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will now complete a simulation study to understand the relationship between the bias, variance, and mean squared error for the estimates for &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; given by these four models at the point &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x = 0.90\)&lt;/span&gt;. We use simulation to complete this task, as performing the analytical calculations would prove to be rather tedious and difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;set.seed(1)
n_sims = 250
n_models = 4
x = data.frame(x = 0.90) # fixed point at which we make predictions
predictions = matrix(0, nrow = n_sims, ncol = n_models)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (sim in 1:n_sims) {

  # simulate new, random, training data
  # this is the only random portion of the bias, var, and mse calculations
  # this allows us to calculate the expectation over D
  sim_data = get_sim_data(f, sample_size = NN)

  # fit models
  fit_0 = lm(y ~ 1,                   data = sim_data)
  fit_1 = lm(y ~ poly(x, degree = 1), data = sim_data)
  fit_2 = lm(y ~ poly(x, degree = 2), data = sim_data)
  fit_9 = lm(y ~ poly(x, degree = 9), data = sim_data)

  # get predictions
  predictions[sim, 1] = predict(fit_0, x)
  predictions[sim, 2] = predict(fit_1, x)
  predictions[sim, 3] = predict(fit_2, x)
  predictions[sim, 4] = predict(fit_9, x)
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compile all of the results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ssc442kirkpatrick.netlify.app/example/09-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png&#34; width=&#34;864&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;fyi&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your breakout room and using the code below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Breakout&lt;/strong&gt;: set &lt;code&gt;NN&lt;/code&gt; = 100, the value we used in our Content 9 lecture. The value is set in one of the first code chunks. Step through the code to get your finalPlot and make sure it looks like the plot in Content 9. I changed the code to use ggplot (easier to save output), so the formatting and colors will be different - that’s OK, we want to get the same results, not copy the layout of the plot. Note that at the end of the code, a list is created that will hold all of your results. In case you need to clear this list, &lt;code&gt;rm(FinalResults)&lt;/code&gt; will do so and the code will initate a new blank list to hold subsequent results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Breakout&lt;/strong&gt;: set NN to a larger number. Usually, more data means more precise predictions. Run your code again stepping through it, until you get to this plot. Note that at the end of the code provided, there is a list that aggregates your results. &lt;strong&gt;Repeat this&lt;/strong&gt; with a 3rd, even larger value for NN. Don’t go much beyond 50,000 or it’ll take too long. Your &lt;code&gt;FinalResults&lt;/code&gt; list should have 3 elements in it. Use &lt;code&gt;patchwork::wrap_plots(FinalResults, nrow = 1)&lt;/code&gt; to see all 3 side-by-side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third Breakout&lt;/strong&gt;: Finally, change the &lt;code&gt;SD.of.Bayes.Error&lt;/code&gt; value to make it higher or lower. Remember, this is the &lt;em&gt;irreducible&lt;/em&gt; error. Run your code again with your first, second, and third different value for sample size &lt;code&gt;NN&lt;/code&gt;. You should have 6 plots in your &lt;code&gt;FinalResults&lt;/code&gt; list - 3 from before, and 3 more with the new SD of Bayes Error. Use &lt;code&gt;wrap_plots&lt;/code&gt; with the right number of rows to see a 2x3 grid of the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usually we think larger sample sizes and lower error lead to better overall prediction. Do we see any change in the bias vs. tradeoff relationship with lower/higher sample size &lt;code&gt;NN&lt;/code&gt; and lower/higher SD of Bayes Error?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
